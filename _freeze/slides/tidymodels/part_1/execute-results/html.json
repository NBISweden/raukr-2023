We'll only use our training set to investigate. \n\n## Some key features\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nclass imbalance\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-imbal-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nClusters of highly correlated features\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-cor-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Feature Engineering\n\nThis describes the process of having good representations of your predictors so that the model has the easiest possible time fitting the data. \n\nFor the multicollinearity, we could: \n\n* Do nothing and see how that works\n* Maybe try feature extraction (e.g. [PCA, PLS, and similar](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/numeric-many-to-many.html))\n* Filter out predictions to reduce correlations\n* Use a model that is resistant to multicollinearity. \n\n## How will we measure performance\n\nWe have to classes; there are [a lot of options](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/measuring-performance.html#class-metrics):\n\n* Accuracy and similar.\n* ROC and PR curves\n* Brier scores\n\nWe'll compute all of these but will focus on Brier scores\n\n## The process of building a model\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/process.svg){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Logistic regression\n\nI usually start simple. Logistic regression is a commonly used model (both for prediction and inference). \n\nWe'll try different versions of logistic regression as well as with different feature representations. \n\nTo get good measures of performance, we will use [resampling methods](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/resampling.html) to compute our results. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Logistic regression results\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-logistic-ranking-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Filtering results\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-logistic-filters-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe best model retained 49 predictors out of 56. \n\n## Partial Least Squares Results\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-logistic-pls-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Evaluating More Models\n\nAt this point we would try different models too (e.g. boosting, etc). \n\nFrom brevity, we'll stop here to illustrate what occurs next. \n\nLet's choose a PLS logistic model as our \"final model.\"\n\nHow does this fit work with the test set? \n\n. . .\n\nThe Brier score was 0.126. \n\n## Test Set Predictions\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-logistic-hist-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Test Set Calibration\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_1_files/figure-revealjs/cell-logistic-cal-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
