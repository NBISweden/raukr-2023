## Git

```{r}

```

::: notes
Git is version control. What does that mean? It means it tracks changes for all files in a repository, which you can think of as a collection of files.
This is not the only way to get version control of your files.
:::

## Project setup

::: notes
1. Create a folder.
2. Make it a Rstudio project.
3. Make it a git repository
:::

## Github

::: notes
Github is the hosting service that allows for syncing your work with other people, in private work groups or in open access collaboration.
The nice thing about having work on github is also that if something really breaks in your local git repo you can always delete it and download a fresh copy off github.
