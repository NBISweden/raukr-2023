Most of the benchmarking the microbenchmark does is implemented in low-overhead C functions and also the package makes sure to:\n\nestimate granularity and resolution of timing for your particular OS,\nwarm up your processor before measuring, i.e. wake the processor up from any idle state or likewise.\n\nBegin by installing the microbenchmark package.\n\n2.3.1 Checking System Time.\nCheck the current value of the platform’s timer.\n\nmicrobenchmark::get_nanotime()\n\nModify the code below so that it uses the current value of platform’s timer:\n\ntiming &lt;- double(100)\nfor (i in 1:100) {\n  st &lt;- system.time(rnorm(n = 10e6))\n  timing[i] &lt;- st[3]\n}\nboxplot(timing)\n\nPut the mean and the variance into this spreadsheet (Best Coding Practises Lab sheet, Microbenchmark – loop)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\ntiming &lt;- double(100)\nfor (i in 1:100) {\n  nanotime_start &lt;- get_nanotime()\n  rnorm(n = 10e6)\n  nanotime_stop &lt;- get_nanotime()\n  timing[i] &lt;- nanotime_stop - nanotime_start\n}\nmean(timing)\nvar(timing)\nboxplot(timing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Microtiming Precision.\nThere is an experimental function in the microbenchmark package that helps the package estimate granularity and resolution of your particular timing subsystem. According to the documentation, the function measures the overhead of timing a C function call rounds times and returns all non-zero timings observed.\n Run the microtiming_precision function and put the mean and the variance of the resulting vector into this spreadsheet (Best Coding Practises Lab sheet, Microbenchmark – precision)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprecision &lt;- microbenchmark::microtiming_precision()\nmean(precision)\nvar(precision)\n\n\n\n\nRun the function one time without assigning its value to a variable and consult the documentation.

After filling the matrix with values, add to each and every element of \\(M\\) the number of column the element is in and return such matrix from the function. Functions should:\nfill_alloc) – use memory allocation prior to loop in which the matrix is being filled and allocate memory using init value passed as argument and by default set to NULL,\nfill_noalloc – not use memory allocation prior to the loop,\nfill_noloop should not the loop for filling the matrix in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDo not perform addition of column number in the same loop.\n\n\nFollowing this and using rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1):\n\nuse Rprof to profile the functions using the same seed and N=100,\nuse Rprof to check whether there is a difference between initializing the matrix using NULL and 0 in fill_alloc,\nwhat happens if \\(N = 10\\) compared to \\(N = 20\\) to \\(N = 100\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill_noloop &lt;- function(N, bag, seed = 42) {\n  set.seed(seed)\n  values &lt;- sample(bag, size = N^2, replace = T)\n  M &lt;- matrix(data = values, nrow = N, byrow = T)\n  for (col_num in 1:N) {\n    M[, col_num] &lt;- M[, col_num] + col_num\n  }\n  return(M)\n}\n\nfill_noalloc &lt;- function(N, bag, seed = 42) {\n  set.seed(seed)\n  values &lt;- sample(bag, size = N^2, replace = T)\n  M &lt;- NULL\n  cnt = 1\n  for (row in 1:N) {\n    row_tmp &lt;- c()\n    for (col in 1:N) {\n      row_tmp &lt;- c(row_tmp, values[cnt])\n      cnt &lt;- cnt + 1\n    }\n    M &lt;- rbind(M, row_tmp)\n  }\n  for (col_num in 1:N) {\n    M[, col_num] &lt;- M[, col_num] + col_num\n  }\n  return(M)\n}\n\nfill_alloc &lt;- function(N, bag, seed = 42, init = NA) {\n  set.seed(seed)\n  values &lt;- sample(bag, size = N^2, replace = T)\n  M &lt;- matrix(rep(init, times=N^2), nrow = N, byrow = T)\n  cnt = 1\n  for (row in 1:N) {\n    for (col in 1:N) {\n      M[row, col] &lt;- values[cnt]\n      cnt &lt;- cnt + 1\n    }\n  }\n  for (col_num in 1:N) {\n    M[, col_num] &lt;- M[, col_num] + col_num\n  }\n  return(M)\n}\n\nsummary &lt;- summaryRprof('profiler_test_fillers.out', memory='both')\nsummary$by.self\n\n# answers to the remaining questions are not given\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Optimization\nHave a look at our answers from the previous task .\n\nHow can you optimize the fill_alloc even further (call the optimized version fill_alloc_opt)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill_alloc_opt &lt;- function(N, bag, seed = 42, init = NA) {\n  set.seed(seed)\n  values &lt;- sample(bag, size = N^2, replace = T)\n  M &lt;- matrix(rep(init, times=N^2), nrow = N, byrow = T)\n  cnt = 1\n  for (row in 1:N) {\n    for (col in 1:N) {\n      M[row, col] &lt;- values[cnt] + col\n      cnt &lt;- cnt + 1\n    }\n  }\n  return(M)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize the fill_noloop to fill_noloops that does not use any loops at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill_noloops &lt;- function(N, bag, seed = 42) {\n  values &lt;- sample(bag, size = N^2, replace = T)\n  inc &lt;- rep(x = 1:N, times = N)\n  M &lt;- matrix(data = values + inc, nrow = N, byrow = T)\n  return(M)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Optiona Task: Using the profr package.\n\nInstall and load the profr package.\nUse profr to profile fill_noloop, fill_noloops and fill_alloc_opt.\n\nPlease use the following function, if you were not able to run profr::ggplot.profr.\n\nggplot.profr &lt;- function(data, ..., minlabel = 0.1, angle=0) {\n  if (!requireNamespace(\"ggplot2\", quietly = TRUE))\n    stop(\"Please install ggplot2 to use this plotting method\")\n  data$range &lt;- diff(range(data$time))\n\n  # quiet R CMD check note\n  start &lt;- NULL\n  end &lt;- NULL\n  time &lt;- NULL\n\n  ggplot2::ggplot(as.data.frame(data)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_rect(\n      ggplot2::aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = level - 0.5, ymax = level + 0.5),\n      fill = \"grey95\", colour = \"black\", size = 0.5) +\n    ggplot2::geom_text(\n      ggplot2::aes(start + range / 60, level, label = f),\n      data = subset(data, time &gt; max(time) * minlabel),\n      size = 4, angle = angle, hjust = 0) +\n    ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\"time\") +\n    ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(\"level\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(profr)\n\nRprof(\"profr_noloop.out\", interval = 0.01)\nfill_noloop(1000, rnorm(1000), seed = 42)\nRprof(NULL)\nprofile_noloop_df &lt;- parse_rprof('profr_noloop.out')\n\nRprof(\"profr_noloops.out\", interval = 0.01)\nfill_noloops(100, rnorm(1000), seed = 42)\nRprof(NULL)\nprofile_noloops_df &lt;- parse_rprof('profr_noloops.out')\n\nRprof(\"profr_alloc_opt.out\", interval = 0.01)\nfill_alloc_opt(10, rnorm(1000), seed = 42)\nRprof(NULL)\nprofile_alloc_opt_df &lt;- parse_rprof('profr_alloc_opt.out')\n\nprofr::ggplot.profr(profile_noloop_df)\nprofr::ggplot.profr(profile_noloops_df)\nprofr::ggplot.profr(profile_alloc_opt_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Optional Task: Using the profvis package.\n\nInstall and load the profvis package.\nUse profvis to profile fill_noloop, and fill_alloc functions."

    "text": "1 Basics\nFirst step is to make sure that the necessary packages are installed and loaded.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nWe use the iris data to get started. This dataset has four continuous variables and one categorical variable. It is important to remember about the data type when plotting graphs.\n\ndata(\"iris\")\nhead(iris)\n\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Building a plot\nggplot2 plots are initialized by specifying the dataset. This can be saved to a variable or it draws a blank plot.\n\nggplot(data=iris)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can specify what we want on the x and y axes using aesthetic mapping. And we specify the geometric using geoms. Note that the variable names do not have double quotes \"\" like in base plots.\n\nggplot(data=iris)+\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Multiple geoms\nFurther geoms can be added. For example let’s add a regression line. When multiple geoms with the same aesthetics are used, they can be specified as a common mapping. Note that the order in which geoms are plotted depends on the order in which the geoms are supplied in the code. In the code below, the points are plotted first and then the regression line.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Using colors\nWe can use the categorical column Species to color the points. The color aesthetic is used by geom_point and geom_smooth. Three different regression lines are now drawn. Notice that a legend is automatically created.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width,color=Species))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to keep a common regression line while keeping the colors for the points, we could specify color aesthetic only for geom_point.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Species))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Aesthetic parameter\nWe can change the size of all points by a fixed amount by specifying size outside the aesthetic parameter.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Species),size=3)+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Aesthetic mapping\nWe can map another variable as size of the points. This is done by specifying size inside the aesthetic mapping. Now the size of the points denote Sepal.Width. A new legend group is created to show this new aesthetic.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Species,size=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Discrete colors\nWe can change the default colors by specifying new values inside a scale.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Species,size=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"red\",\"blue\",\"green\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 Continuous colors\nWe can also map the colors to a continuous variable.

We change the legend title using scale_color_continuous(). All other labels are changed using labs().\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+\n  scale_color_continuous(name=\"New Legend Title\")+\n  labs(title=\"This Is A Title\",subtitle=\"This is a subtitle\",x=\" Petal Length\", \n       y=\"Petal Width\", caption=\"This is a little caption.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9 Axes modification\nLet’s say we are not happy with the x-axis breaks 2,4,6 etc. We would like to have 1,2,3… We change this using scale_x_continuous().\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+\n  scale_color_continuous(name=\"New Legend Title\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:8)+\n  labs(title=\"This Is A Title\",subtitle=\"This is a subtitle\",x=\" Petal Length\", \n       y=\"Petal Width\", caption=\"This is a little caption.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10 Faceting\nWe can create subplots using the faceting functionality. Let’s create three subplots for the three levels of Species.\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+\n  scale_color_continuous(name=\"New Legend Title\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:8)+\n  labs(title=\"This Is A Title\",subtitle=\"This is a subtitle\",x=\" Petal Length\", \n       y=\"Petal Width\", caption=\"This is a little caption.\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Species)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11 Themes\nThe look of the plot can be changed using themes. Let’s can the default theme_grey() to theme_bw().\n\nggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+\n  geom_point(aes(color=Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+\n  scale_color_continuous(name=\"New Legend Title\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:8)+\n  labs(title=\"This Is A Title\",subtitle=\"This is a subtitle\",x=\" Petal Length\", \n       y=\"Petal Width\", caption=\"This is a little caption.\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Species)+\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll non-data related aspects of the plot can be modified through themes. Let’s modify the colors of the title labels and turn off the gridlines.

The x-axis field ‘CPI’ and the y-axis field ‘HDI’ must be of numeric type. The categorical field ‘Region’ must be of Factor type.\n\nstr(ec)\n\n'data.frame':   173 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ X       : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ Country : chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Albania\" \"Algeria\" \"Angola\" ...\n $ HDI.Rank: int  172 70 96 148 45 86 2 19 91 53 ...\n $ HDI     : num  0.398 0.739 0.698 0.486 0.797 0.716 0.929 0.885 0.7 0.771 ...\n $ CPI     : num  1.5 3.1 2.9 2 3 2.6 8.8 7.8 2.4 7.3 ...\n $ Region  : chr  \"Asia Pacific\" \"East EU Cemt Asia\" \"MENA\" \"SSA\" ...\n\n\nWe need to first modify the region column. The current levels in the ‘Region’ field are:\n\nlevels(ec$Region)\n\nNULL\n\n\nBut, the categories on the plot are different and need to be changed as follows:\nFrom                  To\nEU W. Europe          OECD\nAmericas              Americas\nAsia Pacific          Asia & Oceania\nEast EU Cemt Asia     Central & Eastern Europe\nMENA                  Middle East & North Africa\nSSA                   Sub-Saharan Africa\nSince the ‘To’ strings are a bit too long to be in one line on the legend, use \\n to break a line into two lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\\n is the newline character in R.\n\n\nFrom                  To\nEU W.

But a easier way to do it is to use factor(). The arguments levels and labels in function factor() can be used to rename factors.\n\nec$Region &lt;- factor(ec$Region,levels = c(\"EU W.

Use geom_point() to draw point geometry. To select shapes, see here. Circular shape can be drawn using 1, 16, 19, 20 and 21. Using shape ‘21’ allows us to control stroke color, fill color and stroke thickness for the points. Check out ?geom_point and look under ‘Aesthetics’ for the various possible aesthetic options. Set shape to 21, size to 3, stroke to 0.8 and fill to white.\n\n\n\nggplot(ec,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region))+\n    geom_point(shape=21,size=3,stroke=0.8,fill=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how ‘’ has created newlines in the Legend.\n\n\n2.3 Trendline\nNow, we add the trend line using geom_smooth. Check out ?geom_smooth and look under ‘Arguments’ for argument options and ‘Aesthetics’ for the aesthetic options.\n\nUse method ‘lm’ and use a custom formula of y~poly(x,2) to approximate the curve seen on the plot. Turn off confidence interval shading. Set line thickness to 0.6 and line color to red.\n\n\nggplot(ec,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region))+\n  geom_point(shape=21,size=3,stroke=0.8,fill=\"white\")+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",formula=y~poly(x,2),se=F,size=0.6,color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the line in drawn over the points due to the plotting order. We want the points to be over the line. So reorder the geoms. Since we provided no aesthetic mappings to geom_smooth, there is no legend entry for the trendline. We can fake a legend entry by providing an aesthetic, for example; aes(fill=\"red\"). We do not use the color aesthetic because it is already in use and would give us reduced control later on to modify this legend entry.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ec,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region))+\n      geom_smooth(aes(fill=\"red\"),method=\"lm\",formula=y~poly(x,2),se=F,color=\"red\",size=0.6)+\n      geom_point(shape=21,size=3,stroke=0.8,fill=\"white\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Text Labels\nNow we add the text labels. Only a subset of countries are plotted. The list of countries to label is shown below.\n\"Congo\",\"Afghanistan\",\"Sudan\",\"Myanmar\",\"Iraq\",\"Venezuela\",\"Russia\",\"Argentina\",\"Brazil\",\"Italy\",\"South Africa\",\"Cape Verde\",\"Bhutan\",\"Botswana\",\"Britian\",\"New Zealand\",\"Greece\",\"China\",\"India\",\"Rwanda\",\"Spain\",\"France\",\"United States\",\"Japan\",\"Norway\",\"Singapore\",\"Barbados\",\"Germany\"\n\nUse geom_text to subset the original data.frame to the reduced set above and plot the labels as text. See ?geom_text.\n\n\nlabels &lt;- c(\"Congo\",\"Afghanistan\",\"Sudan\",\"Myanmar\",\"Iraq\",\"Venezuela\",\"Russia\",\"Argentina\",\"Brazil\",\"Italy\",\"South Africa\",\"Cape Verde\",\"Bhutan\",\"Botswana\",\"Britian\",\"New Zealand\",\"Greece\",\"China\",\"India\",\"Rwanda\",\"Spain\",\"France\",\"United States\",\"Japan\",\"Norway\",\"Singapore\",\"Barbados\",\"Germany\")\n\np+geom_text(data=subset(ec,Country %in% labels),aes(label=Country),color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Custom Font\nCustom font can be used for the labels by providing the font name to argument family like so geom_text(family=\"fontname\"). If you do not want to bother with fonts, just avoid the family argument in geom_text and skip this part.\nUsing custom fonts can be tricky business. To use a font name, it must be installed on your system and it should be imported into the R environment. This can be done using the extrafont package. Try importing one of the fonts available on your system. Not all fonts work. extrafont prefers .ttf fonts. If a font doesn’t work, try another.\n\nlibrary(extrafont)\nfont_import(pattern=\"Gidole\",prompt=FALSE)\n# load fonts for pdf\nloadfonts()\n# list available fonts in R\nfonts()\n\nThe actual font used on the Economist graph is something close to ITC Officina Sans. Since this is not a free font, I am using a free font called Gidole.\n\np+geom_text(data=subset(ec,Country %in% labels),aes(label=Country),\n            color=\"black\",family=\"Gidole\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Label Overlap\nTo avoid overlapping of labels, we can use a ggplot2 extension package ggrepel. We can use function geom_text_repel() from the ggrepel package. geom_text_repel() has the same arguments/aesthetics as geom_text and a few more. Skip the family=Gidole part if you do not want to change the font.\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\np &lt;- p+geom_text_repel(data=subset(ec,Country %in% labels),aes(label=Country),\n                       color=\"black\",box.padding=unit(1,'lines'),segment.size=0.25,\n                       size=3,family=\"Gidole\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Axes\nNext step is to adjust the axes breaks, axes labels, point colors and relabeling the trendline legend text.\n\nChange axes labels to ‘Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)’ on the x-axis and ‘Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)’ on the y-axis. Set breaks on the x-axis from 1 to 10 by 1 increment and y-axis from 0.2 to 1.0 by 0.1 increments.\n\n\np &lt;- p+scale_x_continuous(name=\"Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)\",\n                          breaks=1:10,limits=c(1,10))+\n      scale_y_continuous(name=\"Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)\",\n                         breaks=seq(from=0,to=1,by=0.1),limits=c(0.2,1))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Scale Colors\nNow we want to change the color palette for the points and modify the legend text for the trendline.\n\nUse scale_color_manual() to provide custom colors. These are the colors to use for the points: \"#23576E\",\"#099FDB\",\"#29B00E\", \"#208F84\",\"#F55840\",\"#924F3E\".\nUse scale_fill_manual to change the trendline label since it’s a fill scale. The legend entry for the trendline should read ‘R^2=52%’.\n\n\np &lt;- p+scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#23576E\",\"#099FDB\",\"#29B00E\", \"#208F84\",\"#F55840\",\"#924F3E\"))+\n       scale_fill_manual(name=\"trend\",values=\"red\",labels=expression(paste(R^2,\"=52%\")))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9 Title\nTitle and caption can be added with labs.\n\nSet the title to ‘Corruption and human development’.\nSet the caption to ‘Sources: Transparency International; UN Human Development Report’.\n\n\np &lt;- p+labs(title=\"Corruption and human development\",\n            caption=\"Sources: Transparency International; UN Human Development Report\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10 Theme\nWe want to move the legend to the top and as a single row. This can be done using theme() option legend.position. See ?theme. guides() is used to set the number of rows to 1. We also set a custom font for all text elements using base_family=\"Gidole\". This can be skipped if a font change is not required.\n\np &lt;- p+guides(color=guide_legend(nrow=1))+\n       theme_bw(base_family=\"Gidole\")+\n       theme(legend.position=\"top\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we do some careful refining with themes.\n\nTurn off minor gridlines\nTurn off major gridlines on x-axis\nRemove the gray background\nRemove panel border\nRemove legend titles\nMake axes titles italic\nTurn off y-axis ticks\nChange x-axis ticks to color grey60\nMake plot title bold\nDecrease size of caption to size 8\n\n\np+theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n          panel.grid.major.x=element_blank(),\n          panel.background=element_blank(),\n          panel.border=element_blank(),\n          legend.title=element_blank(),\n          axis.title=element_text(face=\"italic\"),\n          axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.x=element_line(color=\"grey60\"),\n          plot.title=element_text(face=\"bold\"),\n          plot.caption=element_text(hjust=0,size=8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now our plot is ready and we can compare with the original.

The plot is a heatmap showing the normalized number of cases of measles across 51 US states from 1928 to 2003. X-axis shows years and y-axis shows the names of states. The color of the tiles denote the number of measles cases per 100,000 people. Introduction of the measles vaccine is shown as the black line in 1963.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Data\nDownload the data csv file.\n data_wsj.csv\nStart by reading in the data.

Here are the steps we need to take:\n\nThe data needs to be transformed to long format.\nReplace all “-” with NAs\nThe number of cases across each state is a character and needs to be converted to numeric\nCollapse (sum) week-level data to year.\nAbbreviate state names\n\n\n\n3.2 Tidy Data\nConvert the wide format to long format using the function gather() from package dplyr.\n\nme1 &lt;- me %&gt;% gather(key=state,value=value,-YEAR,-WEEK)\nhead(me1)\n\n\n\n\n\nYEAR\nWEEK\nstate\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n1928\n1\nALABAMA\n3.67\n\n\n1928\n2\nALABAMA\n6.25\n\n\n1928\n3\nALABAMA\n7.95\n\n\n1928\n4\nALABAMA\n12.58\n\n\n1928\n5\nALABAMA\n8.03\n\n\n1928\n6\nALABAMA\n7.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, replace all ‘-’ with NA in the field value.

This can be done using the summarise() function from package dplyr.\n\nA custom function is used to sum over weeks. If all values are NA, then result is NA. If some values are NA, the NAs are removed and the remaining numbers are summed.\nThe dots in state names are replaced by spaces and the words are converted to title case (First letter capital and rest lowercase).\nWe also convert the column names to lowercase for consistency.\n\n\nfun1 &lt;- function(x) ifelse(all(is.na(x)),NA,sum(x,na.rm=TRUE))\n\nme3 &lt;- me2 %&gt;% group_by(YEAR,state)

    "text": "2 Working with git and GitHub starting from RStudio\nLet’s go through the common situation of starting a new project and connecting it to git and GitHub. Let’s create a mental model for this: Hypothetically, you have just been asked to perform some data analysis, produce some plots, and now it is time to start!\n\nIn RStudio, create a new project in a new directory. You can initialize it as a git repository upon creation or you can do that after using usethis::use_git().\nConnect it to GitHub using usethis::use_github().\nCreate an R script in your project and write some code. You are free to do whatever you want here. Write a function, create a plot, use a public dataset. Go crazy!\nUse the RStudio git pane to commit your code including a commit message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npush the changes to your GitHub repository. Then go to GitHub and check that you can see your changes there. In your mental model, this is you sharing your code with your collaborators or users.\nNow introduce some changes to your script from GitHub and commit them. At this point, your GitHub repository is one commit ahead of your local repository. In the mental model, this can be your collaborators making changes in their local repository and pushing it to your shared GitHub project, or a user suggesting a change, that you accept, in your publicly available R-package, used by millions. For now, lets ignore thinking about who has access to commit to your repository, but do not worry, there are ways to safeguard this. Your code can be open on GitHub without other people being able to ruin it so you have to constantly go back to a previous unruined commit!\nTo transfer the changes in the GitHub repository to your local repository, go back to RStudio and use the blue arrow in the git pane to pull the changes. In the mental model this is you updating your code with the code contributed by your collaborators. Notice here that if if you had in the meantime made some changes to the local repository in the same R script and position as you had on GitHub, there would be what is called a “merge conflict” when you tried to pull. We will get to those later.\nLet’s look at the diff operation. Make some changes in your local repository R script again, both removing and adding something, then press the diff button in the git pane. This should bring up a new window that is similar to the image below. As you can see it clearly shows you what has been added and what has been removed, what the difference is since your last commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and commit the changes you made. No need to push them to GitHub. Now lets go into our mental model and say that you did not like those changes. You have done something you regret, or broken something, and you want to go back. One of the main points of version control after all is the ability to go back. For this you will have to use the terminal pane in RStudio. In essence, what you are doing now is using git from the terminal in your local repository, this is because the git operations necessary to go back are not currently built into RStudio. Here are the commands we will be using:\n\n\ngit reset HEAD~1\ngit restore &lt;our R script&gt;\n\ngit reset HEAD~n steps you back in your commit history n commits. In this case HEAD~1 means go one commit back. Look at your R script, are the changes you made still there? They should be. You have gone back one commit, not removed the changes you made during that commit. But now that we are on this commit you can git restore your R script file to take it back to the way it was at the start of current commit. Go ahead and try it out and make sure it works as you would expect it to!\nNow you should have all the tools you need to work with git in a basic capacity, starting from a new project on your device. Notice that you do not need to start from a new project, you can also take a folder with lots of work you have already performed and make it an R project and initialize git in it. It will of course only track changes from that point, not what you have done previously, but it is still a good idea!\nThe point here being that starting from scratch or starting from a bunch of work that you have already done, or starting by creating a GitHub repository and pulling that into RStudio using File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git , there are tools for any situation and it is not too late to start working reproducibly, collaboratively and with backups using git!"

    "section": "3 Additional topics and exercises",
    "text": "3 Additional topics and exercises\n\n3.1 Branches\nBranches in git are a way to create a separate version controlled instance of your repository. Think of your git changes as a tree trunk, growing as you add and commit, but always possible to reset and go back down to a lower point on the trunk. Then branching is the equivalent of a branch shooting out at a certain point on that trunk with the possibility to grow as you develop that branch. This permits you or someone else to work on a separate idea at the same time as you continue to develop the trunk. Say for example that you have a situation where there is a stable release of your R package and you do not want to push changes to this. So you create a branch called “development” and when you are happy with it you merge that branch back into the trunk!\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful commands for branches from terminal:\n\ngit branch &lt;name of branch&gt; : Create a new branch.\ngit branch : See list of branches. Current branch marked with *.\ngit checkout &lt;name of branch&gt; : Move to branch.\ngit merge &lt;name of branch&gt; : Merge the branch you are currently on with the branch named in command.\n\nHowever, you can work with branches from RStudio as well! To do this you can use the purpleish button in git pane that looks like two squares connected with a diamond. Once you have created a new branch you can switch branches to the right of the branch button in the git pane.\nExercise:\n\nEither create a new git version controlled R project in Rstudio, or continue from your last one.\nCreate a new branch using RStudio. Make sure you are on that branch afterwards.\nIntroduce some changes in your R script. commit them. In our mental model, this is you developing something experimental until you are satisfied with it.\nSwitch back to the main branch.\nTo merge the new branch with our main branch we will use the terminal again. In the RStudio terminal perform the merge. In the mental model this you being satisfied with the development branch and calling it a stable release, a part of the main body of code!\n\nCongratulations, you now know how to create a branch, switch between branches, and merge the branch back into main.\n\n\n3.2 Merge conflicts\nEarlier we thought about the issue of changes being introduces in the same file and position in your local copy of a repository and in the GitHub version of the repository at the same time. A so called “merge conflict”. This can also happen if you are working on two branches, introduce changes in the same places, and then try to merge! But you should try not to worry too much about merge conflicts, they can be solved if you know what you are doing.\n\nIntroducing changes in the same part of your code on your main and new branch. commit the changes.\nUse git merge &lt;name of branch&gt; from the main branch. This should result in the merge conflict.\n\nThe output you should get from the merge is similar to:\n\nAuto-merging file.R\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.R\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n\nYou can also use git status from terminal to check which file is modified and why.\nOnce a merge conflict occurs the file effected is modified to reflect the conflicting areas. It can look something like this:\n\n#Hello world!\"\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\na &lt;- 2\n\nb &lt;- 2\n=======\na &lt;- 3\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; test\n\nIn this instance it is telling us that in branch named “test” a &lt;- 3but on our main branch a &lt;- 2 and b &lt;- 2 has also been added. To pick which one you want to go with simply delete the &gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;,== notifiers and whichever rows of code that you do not want. Once you have done this, finalize the merge by commiting the changed files.\n\nFix your merge conflict and finalize the merge.\n\nGood job! You know know how to resolve merge conflicts!\n\n\n3.3 Forks and pull requests\nForking a repository on GitHub means creating a local copy of the repository on your GitHub user. This can be very useful if you want to make some changes to a repository that you do not have push access to, for example. It is also a great way collaborate because it adds more backups of the repository and because of “pull requests”, which are a way of implementing your local changes to the source repository where the owner of the repository has the power to review and choose whether to accept them or not.\nFor example, in this RaukR course we have a repository for all the teaching materials that all teachers have forked, made changes to and then submitted a pull request back to the source repository.\nTo fork a repository you can either use the GitHub website of the repository you want to fork, or you can use usethis. If you are using RStudio it will also automatically create a R project for the local repository.\n\nusethis::create_from_github(\n  \"https://github.com/&lt;user name of owner&gt;/&lt;repository name&gt;\",\n  destdir = \"~/path/to/place/repo/\",\n  fork = TRUE)\n\nThis command does a lot of things, from happygitwithr\n\n\nForks the source repo on GitHub.\nClones your fork to a new local repo (and RStudio Project). This configures your fork as the origin remote.\nConfigures the source repo as the upstream remote.\nSets the upstream tracking branch for main (or whatever the default branch is) to upstream/main.\nOpens a new RStudio instance in the new local repo (and RStudio Project).\n\n\nWe have not covered “upstream” and “remote” in our git vocabulary yet. Basically remotes are connections for your repository, and being upstream means being a repository closer to the source than your repository, which is downstream (as it is a fork). So the sentence “Configures the source repo as the upstream remote” translates to adding a connection specifying that the source repository is where your repository came from. This connection is used update your fork with any future changes that occur in the source repository.\n\nFork the repository https://github.com/Sebastian-D/testgit using one of the methods described. Also clone a local copy of it. Make sure you can find your fork on GitHub.\n\nNow we are ready to make some changes to the code in the our local repository. But before this we should create a new branch for the pull request. For this we can use usethis::pr_init(branch = \"branchName\"). This will also automatically switch to the branch.\n\nCreate a branch then make some changes to the repository. In the mental model you are implementing some feature or fixing some bug.\n\nTo submit a pull request you can use pr_push(). This should open a browser where you can submit the pull request. If the maintainer of the source repository wants to modify the pull request he can either do this himself or suggest some changes to you, whereupon you make the changes the run pr_push() again.\n\nSubmit the pull request! Go ahead and view it on GitHub.\n\nThere is a whole family of pr-* functions for both the person submitting the pull the request and the maintainer of the source repository that will review and accept/decline the pull request. I really recommend you read here if you think this is of interest!\nGood job completing the exercises! git and GitHub are big topics, but know a little gets you a long way and then you discover the rest when you need it!"

This will allow us to better understand the concepts like learning rate, gradient descent as well as to get an intuition of forward- and back-propagation. First of all, let us denote the sigmoid activation function on the output node as\n\\[\\phi(s)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp^{\\displaystyle -s}}\\]\nThe beauty of this function is that it has a simple derivative that is expressed through the sigmoid function itself:\n\\[\\phi^\\prime(s)=\\phi(s)\\left(1-\\phi(s)\\right)\\]\nNext, the loss MSE function, i.e. the squared difference between the prediction y and the truth d, is given by the following simple equation:\n\\[E(w_1,w_2)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(d_i-y_i(w_1,w_2)\\right)^2; \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, y(w_1,w_2)=\\phi(w_1x_1+w_2x_2)\\]\nFinally, the gradient descent update rule can be written as follows:\n\\[w_{1,2}=w_{1,2}-\\mu\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{1,2}}\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{1,2}}=-(d-y)*y*(1-y)*x_{1,2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is a learning rate.

    "text": "4 Insert wondrous things\nNow that we have a R package backbone lets fill it with stuff!\n\n4.1 R code\nLet’s create the first function of your package. We can use the handy helper-function usethis::use_r() to create or navigate between the R files in your R/ folder. You can also just create a .R file there if you wish.\nusethis::use_r(\"trianguletter\")\nThis should create and open the file R/trianguletter.R for editing.\nFeel free to rewrite the function to perform some simple task. From adding two numbers to creating a basic plot from some input. It’s up to you!\nHere is an example that I threw together:\n\ntrianguletter &lt;- function(x) {\n  for(i in 1:x){\n    cat(rep( letters[i], times = i),\"\\n\")\n  }\n}\n\nWhen you are happy with your function, save it. To access and test your newly created function we have to attach it to make it available. But rather than bundle, install and attach we can use the function devtools::load_all() while developing the package. load_all() simulates the behavior of bundling, installing and attaching the package, without actually having to do it.\nNow test your function in the console!\n\ntrianguletter(12)\n\na \nb b \nc c c \nd d d d \ne e e e e \nf f f f f f \ng g g g g g g \nh h h h h h h h \ni i i i i i i i i \nj j j j j j j j j j \nk k k k k k k k k k k \nl l l l l l l l l l l l \n\n\nCongratulations! You have just created an R package that fulfills a function!\n\n\n4.2 Data\nLets add some data to our package, create an R object with whatever information you want. A string, a vector or a data.frame, as long as you recognize it, it doesn’t matter. First we will save it to our data/ folder using usethis::use_data().\n\n# A random object\nyour_object &lt;- c('red','green','blue')\n\n#Save to data\nusethis::use_data(your_object)\n\nThis created the data/ folder and your_object.rda inside it.\n\nNow when our package is loaded, your_object will be made available to the user. To test this, remove all objects from your working directory, and load all functions. Check that you can access the object, despite just removing it from your workspace.\n\n# Clear workspace\nrm(list=ls())\n\n# Load all functions and data from our package\ndevtools::load_all()\n\n# Check if we can access our saved object\nyour_object\n[1] \"red\"   \"green\" \"blue\"\n\nThe data in data/ folder is available to the user, needs to be documented, and is where you would store data if the purpose of your package is to distribute one or more datasets in an R friendly way. If there is some data that you don’t want to make easily accessible to the users, AKA not document, but that your functions use, you can put it in sysdata.rda. Lets create a second object. Like the last one it does not matter what it is. Use the same command as before to save the object, except this time specify that this data is intended for internal use.\n\n# Create a second object\nsecond_object &lt;- \"It works!\"\n\n# Save it to R/sysdata.rda\nusethis::use_data(second_object, internal = TRUE)\n\nTo check that this worked, clear your workspace and edit your packages function, the .R file, to include the object in some way. Load the package and see if it executes as expected.\n\n# Clear workspace\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n# Example .R code edit\ntrianguletter &lt;- function(x) {\n  for(i in 1:x){\n    cat(rep( letters[i], times = i),\"\\n\")\n  }\n  # Check if second object can be called by our function\n  cat(second_object)\n}\n\n\n# Load all functions and data from our package\ndevtools::load_all()\n\n\n# Test the function\ntrianguletter(5)\n\na \nb b \nc c c \nd d d d \ne e e e e \nIt works!\n\n\nGreat work! You have created external and internal datasets and shown that they can be used when your package is loaded in the console and in your packages own functions!\n\n\n4.3 Documentation\nNow that we have a function and a dataset, lets use roxygen2 to create some documentation for them.\n\n4.3.1 Function documentation\nAs was discussed in the presentation, the roxygen2 documentation for a function is directly before it in so called “comment blocks”, or #'. Here is a brief refresher:\n\nComment block : #'\nTags : @tagname\n\n@param : parameter\n@example : examples\n@return : what does the function return. The value field in R documentation\n@section : create any section you want\n@export : export the function so it can be used externally\n\n\nGo ahead and create documentation for your function. Add at least a title, a description, multi-section details, the parameters, the expected return value or output, an example of how to use your function and the export tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe @export tag should always be last in documentation and grants the user access to the function. It is very important, if you want the user to be able to call the function. For internal functions, this may not be the case.\n\n\nAn example functional documentation:\n\n#' A right sided triangle of alphabetic letters\n#'\n#' A right sided triangle of alphabetic letters\n#'\n#' This function takes a number as input and outputs an increasing\n#'     number of alphabetic letters on top of each other, resembling\n#'     a right sided triangle.\n#' @section Warning:\n#' Not tested for numbers over 26!\n#'\n#' @param x A number.\n#' @return Outputs to console. NULL object returned.\n#' @examples\n#' trianguletter(10)\n#' @export\ntrianguletter &lt;- function(x) {\n  for(i in 1:x){\n    cat(rep( letters[i], times = i),\"\\n\")\n  }\n  # Check if second object can be called by our function\n  cat(second_object)\n}\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your documentation, build it using devtools::document(). This creates the .Rd file in man/ which is parsed by R when you request the functions documentation. Additionally, the first time you build documentation it will make some edits to your DESCRIPTION and check on your NAMESPACE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may have gotten a warning message that your NAMESPACE was not generated by roxygen2. This is good behavior by roxygen2, it doesn’t want to change something the user has created a certain way. In this case however, we want the NAMESPACE to be handled by roxygen2, so delete the NAMESPACE file and run devtools::document() again to have roxygen2 create it.\n\n\nGo ahead and preview your function as you would any method and make sure that it looks the way you were expecting.\n\n?trianguletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Data documentation\nData documentation is a bit different from functional documentation. Remember that you do not need to document datasets not intended for users, so don’t worry about sysdata.rda. What we want to document in this case is the data you created in man/your_object.rda, or whichever name you have given it.\nThe principle is very similar to functional documentation, but not all tags that are applicable to functions are applicable to data, and should not be used. Similarly, there are some tags that are applicable to data, but not to functions. Usually this is the information you would give a dataset:\n\nData documentation\n\nTitle\nDescription\n@format : what rows and variables are in the data?\n@source : where is the data from?\n\n\nFirst of all, lets check what the output of requesting help for your dataset is currently.\n\n?your_object\n\nAs expected, it is undocumented. Since we cannot add this information to the dataset file, your_object.rda, like we did with the functions documentation, lets create an R file in R/ called data.R and add the documentation there. The name we document has to be the same name as the dataset object you created earlier. Go ahead and document your dataset now.\n\n#' A vector with three strings\n#'\n#' A dataset containing three strings usually linked to the\n#'    colors of pixels on a screen.\n#'\n#' @format A vector with three strings:\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{red}{A string, it's red.}\n#'   \\item{green}{A string, it's green. Street talk for money.}\n#'   \\item{blue}{A string, really didn't see that coming. It's blue this time!}\n#' }\n#' @source \\url{http://www.themindofsebastian.com}\n\"your_object\"\n\nOnce you are happy with your documentation, save the file and run devtools::document(). Now check the help page for your dataset again.\n\n?your_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell done! You have successfully created documentation for a function and a dataset and shown that it can be queried within R.\n\n\n\n4.4 DESCRIPTION\nNow lets take a look at our DESCRIPTION file, at this point it should look similar to this:\nPackage: newpkg\nTitle: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthors@R: \n    person(\"First\", \"Last\", , \"first.last@example.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"YOUR-ORCID-ID\"))\nDescription: What the package does (one paragraph).\nLicense: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a\n    license\nEncoding: UTF-8\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.2.0\nDepends: \n    R (&gt;= 2.10)\nLazyData: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information can look slightly different depending on how the package was created.\n\n\nLooks pretty good but some information definitely needs to be updated if you are ever going to submit this to a repository.\nUpdate the Title, Author and Description fields.\nWhen it comes to the License field, Just in case you don’t want to consider which license to give your package, why not choose one of the most common ones that were mentioned during the lecture?\n\nMIT : Free, but your license must be included in any following work.\nGPL-3 : Even more free. If someone uses your code, whatever they are doing must also be GPL compatible.\nCC0 : Totally free.\n\nOne good way of adding the license is not to just update the DESCRIPTION, but to use a function such as use_mit_license(). It not only updates your DESCRIPTION, but also adds the file LICENSE and LICENSE.md to your package, with relevant license information.\nA good place to look at the meaning of licenses is https://tldrlegal.com.\nNow that your DESCRIPTION is up to shape, we can move on to the NAMESPACE.\n\n\n4.5 NAMESPACE\nRoxygen2 made our function available to the users in our NAMESPACE and made sure that our package works well with other packages. Basically, you should almost never be editing your NAMESPACE by hand.\n\n4.5.1 Import\nFirst, lets import a function from a package and add its functionality to the function we created. This is very handy for using functions from other packages in your package and for making sure your package uses only that function when it is called, no matter the users environment.\n\nCreate a new file called R/utility.R. We won’t actually put any internal utility functions there, but this is a typical place where you would import functions from other packages.\nNext add code to import the melt function from reshape2. This is in the form @importFrom pkg function. Since this kind of documentation has to precede a function or object, we will give it the NULL object, by convention.\n\n\n#' @importFrom reshape2 melt\nNULL\n\nTo update the NAMESPACE run devtools::document().\nNow your NAMESPACE should look like this:\n# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand\n\nexport(trianguletter)\nimportFrom(reshape2,melt)\nGreat! If the melt command from reshape2 is ever used in your package, it will know which one to use. But for our package to use reshape2 we first have to import it in DESCRIPTION.\nTo add the Imports field and the reshape2 information to your DESCRIPTION you can use the usethis::use_package command.\n\nusethis::use_package(\"reshape2\")\n\nWhile Imports means that if someone installs your package it will automatically install reshape2 as well, regrettably it does not mean that if reshape2 is missing when we reinstall it locally it will be downloaded and installed. Luckily we installed it at the start of the exercise.\n\n\n4.5.2 Testing the imported function\nNow that we have added melt from reshape2 lets add it to our function. You can do this any way you like, or copy usage from the example function.\nIn this example the head of iris dataset before and after melt is viewed, to see that it had an effect.\n\n#' A right sided triangle of alphabetic letters\n#'\n#' A right sided triangle of alphabetic letters\n#'\n#' This function takes a number as input and outputs an increasing\n#'     number of alphabetic letters on top of eachother, resembling\n#'     a right sided triangle.\n#' @section Warning:\n#' Not tested for numbers over 26!\n#'\n#' @param x A number.\n#' @return Outputs to console. NULL object returned.\n#' @examples\n#' trianguletter(10)\n#' @export\ntrianguletter &lt;- function(x) {\n  for(i in 1:x){\n    cat(rep( letters[i], times = i),\"\\n\")\n  }\n  # Check if second object can be called by our function\n  #cat(second_object)\n  #what iris dataset looks like\n  cat(\"before melt:\\n\")\n  print(head(iris))\n  #Use melt and see what it looks like\n  cat(\"after melt:\\n\")\n  print(head(melt(iris)))\n}\n\nUse devtools::load_all() to reload your package and it’s imports. You can check that reshape2 was also loaded with sessionInfo().\nTest your function, does the output show that it can use melt?\nNow, lets check that the NAMESPACE is doing what we want it to do, making sure that the correct melt is being used by our package. Lets define a new function, also named melt, in our global environment. That is to say we just define it from the R console.\n\nmelt &lt;- function(x) {\n   cat(\"abc\",x)}\n\nNow try your function again. Is it using the correct melt?\nIt should be!\nTry using melt(iris) in your R console, as it is used in your packages function. It should not work. This is because it is using the melt function you just defined, and it is getting in the way of using the correct function!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn alternative way of achieving the behaviour of a correct NAMESPACE is writing your code with strict package references. In our case reshape2::melt(). This way you can circumvent using roxygen2 to add import tags to NAMESPACE if you want. I recommend doing both =)."

Edit the header data, change title and add an author, then create a minimal vignette for your function. Do run your function and show your dataset using knitr from the vignette. It can be as short as you want, however if you do this for a real package it should be a long form manual showing how your package can use its functions or data to perform the task it was designed for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo be able to use the functions of your package in the vignette you will need to install your package, the easiest way is to execute devtools::install().\n\n\nTo preview your vignette while working on it, press the knit button in Rstudio.\nExample vignette.Rmd:\n---\ntitle: \"How to write more and more letters, in a triangle\"\nauthor: \"Sebastian DiLorenzo\"\ndate: \"2023-06-12\"\noutput: rmarkdown::html_vignette\nvignette: &gt;\n  %\\VignetteIndexEntry{How to write more and more letters, in a triangle}\n  %\\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}\n  %\\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  collapse = TRUE,\n  comment = \"#&gt;\"\n)\n\n# replace this with your package name\nlibrary(newpkg)\n```\n\n# The greatest package for a very specific purpose\n\nIf you thought that it was impossible to write letters\nalphabetically from top to bottom with each number represented\nthe same number of times asits position in the alphabet\n  - think again!\n\nThis package and its sole function, trianguletter, solves just this problem!\n\nBut you do not have to take my word for it, see for yourself:\n\n```{r}\n# With just a simple number we specify how long into the alphabet we go.\ntrianguletter(10)\n\n# Also, this package has this random dataset:\nyour_object\n```\n\n# Future plans\n\nWe plan to add features so that you can give it\na letter, rather than a number, and output a\nbunch of numbers instead!\n\nAnd the beautiful rendered version:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe preview you get when knitting the vignette.Rmd does not mean that the vignette has been created. When you are happy with the vignette, use devtools::build_vignettes(). To view the vignette as an external user would view it is for some reason a bit of a hassle for the package you are developing, perhaps because the output is pretty much the same as when you knit. If you want to do this you can build your package source with devtools::build(), which also builds the vignette, and then devtools::load_all(). Then view the vignette with browseVignettes(\"packagename\").\nOnce again, good work! Now you have written a short guide to your package that will be included wherever it goes!"

As it suggests we can now use usethis::use_test() to create a template test for a function.\nWe will create a new function to test, since trianguletter() uses cat() which is standard output, it is advanced to run tests on it. As always you are free and encouraged to create your own function. The example is for inspiration.\nCreate a new function in R/divider.R\n\nusethis::use_r(\"trivider\")\n\nAnd define the function.\ntrivider &lt;- function(x){\n  x / 3\n}\nNow lets create the test using:\nusethis::use_test(\"trivider\")\nThis creates the file tests/testthat/test-trivider.R, which is where we will write our tests for that function.

Here you can write any C++ function you want, either do this or leave it as it is and we will use the included example function, timesTwo. The function is exported to R using // [[Rcpp::export]].

Add documentation to your function in the same way as we have done previously, but with the C++ commenting style of //'.\n//' Multiply a number by two\n//'\n//' @param x A integer.\n//' @export\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\nNumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {\n  return x * 2;\n}\nSave the file to your src/ directory and call pkgbuild::compile_dll(), which re-compiles the package, implementing our changes. Now run devtools::document() to update your NAMESPACE. Lets install and restart using Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + B in Rstudio. This will create the file RcppExports.R in R/, which is what R uses to call your C++ function.\nTest that your function works from console.\nYour R package can now run C++ code, marvelous!

To do this you will need a github account. Since git usage is covered later in the course, you can return to this. But if you want you are very welcome to follow this guide. It does require that you have git installed, accessible and configured on your local computer.\nTo initialize git for your R package, so it becomes a local repository, you first need to run the command:\nusethis::use_git()\nTo initialize a new github repository with the same name as your R package and push your files there, you can use this command:\nusethis::use_github()\nAt this point, you should have a new repository on your github that has your R package files inside it. This is fantastic! Not only does this mean you can now install your package from any other computer , but we can also setup github actions!\nCheck that you can install your package directly from the github repository using a command of the form devtools::install_github(\"Username/repository_name\").\n\n\n10.2 Github actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGithub actions are only free for public repositories. Do not create a private repository, for example under your organisation, for this exercise!\n\n\nLet’s set up our R package so that it will test if it passes R CMD CHECK on three major operating systems.\nThe first thing you will need to do is make sure your github account can use actions/workflows. If you are using a personal access token go to (user, not repo) Settings&gt;Developer settings&gt;Personal access tokens on your github account and make sure you have selected a Scope called workflow.\nNow lets add an action to our R-package. It is possible to do this manually but luckily there are some example workflows you can use for the most common cases at https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples. To add the action, we will use the usethis package, similarly to how we used it to initiate vignettes earlier. Issue the command usethis::use_github_action(\"check-standard\") in your R package R session, which will select the standard CI workflow from the link.\nWhat this actually did is create the folders and file .github/workflows/check-standard.yaml which github will know to look for in a repository for instructions to run actions.\nNow commit and push these newly added files to your git repository the Actions tab on github will commence running an action, checking your R package for compatibility with several operating systems, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is it, now you know all the most important bits about creating an R package.

We can ignore this by changing our options: options(future.rng.onMisuse=\"ignore\").\n\n\n\nAdd an approach from yesterdays lecture on benchmarking or some other way that you are comfortable with to calculate the time it takes to complete the operation of simply assigning the future. Do not evaluate the future yet by asking for the outcome value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should not attempt to calculate times taken within the future, always wrap this around futures.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Split your sampling into multiple futures and compute the time again. Did it complete faster? \nQuestion 2: Change to plan(multisession) or plan(multicore) according to your setup (operating system type, RStudio or just console). Compute the time again for your multiple futures. Did it complete faster? Think about what the time it takes to compute implies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSometimes there are issues running plan(multicore) and even plan(multisession) in Rstudio. If this happens, you might want to just start R console from a terminal window.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Ask for the outcome of your futures after their definitions, thus evaluating them. How does this influence the time it takes to perform the operations? \nAt this stage your code should, in pseudocode, look something like this:\n\nplan(multisession)\n\ntimer(\n  a %&lt;-% {sample expression}\n  b %&lt;-% {sample expression}\n  #evaluate futures by requesting outcome values\n  a + b\n)\n\nQuestion 4: If you have more than two availableCores(), split the sample() expression to even more futures . Does this influence time to complete in the manner you thought? \n\n\n2.2 Errors\n\nIntroduce an error in one of your future expressions.\n\nQuestion 5: Does the error output when the future is defined and unresolved, or when it is resolved? \nFurther reading about errors and debugging for futures.\n\n\n2.3 for loops\nTo use futures in for loops we can use named indices to assign the future to environments. This is pretty similar to assigning values to named indices with the normal assigner &lt;-, the main difference being that we need to use new environments and we can have multiple expressions for futures.\nFor example:\n\nplan(multisession)\n\n#Create a new environment\nv &lt;- new.env()\nfor (name in c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")) {\n  v[[name]] %&lt;-% {\n        #expression(s)\n     }\n}\n#Turn the environment back into a list\nv &lt;- as.list(v)\n\n#To turn the list of vectors into the same format, one long vector, that we had above when running \"a + b + c\"\nvec &lt;- Reduce(c,v)\n\n\nUse this to divide the sample() operation into however many smaller pieces you want. Do remember to transform your output back into the object we started with before parallelizing the execution.\n\nNow you know the basics of using the future package. With this you have already come a long way in lowering the threshold to implement parallel methods and seeing parallel solutions when you run into it next!"

You are given the option to set title, author etc as well as output format. Set the output format as html. This document is a quarto notebook or R notebook. You can set the display mode to be Source or Visual (where text formatting is shown).\nYou could just enter some text in the qmd file and render it and that would render a plain HTML file by default. And that’s fine. But, it is often useful to enter some metadata information such as title, author etc. And this is defined in the YAML matter.\n\n1.1 YAML\nThe content on the top of the quarto document within three dashes is the YAML matter. This is optional. It is really up to the author to decide how much information needs to be entered here. Here are some common base level YAML parameters.\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nsubtitle: \"A subtitle for the report\"\ndescription: \"This is a longer description of this report.\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"25-Apr-2022\"\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default output format is html and this can be changed or arguments for this can be adjusted by specifying this in the yaml. Here is an updated version:\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nsubtitle: \"A subtitle for the report\"\ndescription: \"This is a longer description of this report.\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: last-modified\ndate-format: \"DD-MMM-YYYY\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    number-sections: true\n    number-depth: 4\n---\n\n# Section 1\n\nThis is some text\n\n# Section 2\n\nHere is some more text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate is now set as last-modified which means it is automatically updated whenever the document is rendered. The date format is adjusted by setting date-format: “DD-MMM-YYYY”. In addition, the output format is now explicitly specified. The table of contents is enabled and it’s depth is set to 4. Section numberings are enabled and depth is set to 4. Try changing some of these arguments to see how it affects the output.\nHere is a more complex version:\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nsubtitle: \"A subtitle for the report\"\ndescription: \"This is a longer description of this report.\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: last-modified\ndate-format: \"DD-MMM-YYYY\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    title-block-banner: true\n    smooth-scroll: true\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    toc-location: right\n    number-sections: true\n    number-depth: 4\n    code-fold: true\n    code-tools: true\n    code-copy: true\n    code-overflow: wrap\n    df-print: kable\n    standalone: false\n    fig-align: left\n---\n\n# Section 1\n\nThis is some text\n\n# Section 2\n\nHere is some more text\n\n```{r}\ndate()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle-block-banner: true displays the blue banner. code-fold: true folds the code and reduces clutter. code-copy: true adds a copy icon in the code chunk and allows the code to be copied easily. code-tools: true adds options to the top right of the document to allow the user to show/hide all code chunks and view source code. df-print: kable sets the default method of displaying tables. standalone: false specifies if all assets and libraries must be integrated into the output html file as a standalone document.\nFor a complete guide to YAML metadata for HTML, see here.\n\n\n1.2 Text\nThe above level 2 heading was created by specifying # Section 1. Other headings can be specified similarly.\n## Level 2 heading  \n### Level 3 heading  \n#### Level 4 heading  \n##### Level 5 heading  \n###### Level 6 heading\nThis *This is italic text* becomes This is italic text.\nTHis **This is italic text** becomes This is bold text.\nSubscript written like this H~2~O renders as H2O.\nSuperscript written like this 2^10^ renders as 210.\nBullet points are usually specified using -.\n- Point one\n- Point two\n\nPoint one\nPoint two\n\nBlock quotes can be specified using &gt;.\n&gt; This is a block quote.

For example:\n\n\n\nThis is a caption\n\n\nBy default, the image is displayed at full scale or until it fills the display width. The image dimension can be adjusted ![This is a caption](assets/gotland.jpg){width=40%}.\n\n\n\nThis is a caption\n\n\nFor finer control, raw HTML can be used. For example;\n&lt;img src=\"assets/gotland.jpg\" width=\"150px\"&gt;\n\nImages can also be displayed using R code. Chunks option out.width in RMarkdown can be used to control image display size.\nThis image is displayed at a size of 200 pixels.\n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"200px\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"assets/gotland.jpg\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image is displayed at a size of 75 pixels.\n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"75px\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"assets/gotland.jpg\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Code\nText can be formatted as code. Code is displayed using monospaced font. Code formatting that stands by itself as a paragraph is called block code. Block codes are specified using three backticks ``` followed by code and then three more backticks.\nThis text below\n```\nThis is generic block code.\n```\nrenders like this\nThis is generic block code.\nCode formatting can also be included in the middle of a sentence. This is called inline code formatting. Using this `This is an inline formatted code.` renders like this: This is an inline formatted code.\nThe above codes are not actually executed. They are just text formatted in a different font. Code can be executed by specifying the language along with the backticks. Block code formatted as such:\n```{r}\nstr(iris)\n```\nrenders like this:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nCode blocks are called chunks. The chunk is executed when this document is rendered. In the above example, the rendered output has two chunks; input and output chunks. The rendered code output is also given code highlighting based on the language. For example;\nThis code chunk\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nggplot(dfr4,aes(x=Month,y=fraction,colour=Year,group=Year))+\n  geom_point(size=2)+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(x=\"Month\",y=\"Fraction of support issues\")+\n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"#000000\",\"#E69F00\",\"#56B4E9\",\n  \"#009E73\",\"#F0E442\",\"#006699\",\"#D55E00\",\"#CC79A7\"))+\n  theme_bw(base_size=12,base_family=\"Gidole\")+\n  theme(panel.border=element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks=element_blank())\n```\nwhen rendered (echo: true by default, but not evaluated) looks like\n\nggplot(dfr4,aes(x=Month,y=fraction,colour=Year,group=Year))+\n  geom_point(size=2)+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(x=\"Month\",y=\"Fraction of support issues\")+\n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"#000000\",\"#E69F00\",\"#56B4E9\",\n  \"#009E73\",\"#F0E442\",\"#006699\",\"#D55E00\",\"#CC79A7\"))+\n  theme_bw(base_size=12,base_family=\"Gidole\")+\n  theme(panel.border=element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks=element_blank())\n\nThe behaviour of code chunks can be adjusted using chunk parameters or execution options. The chunk has several options which can be used to control chunk properties.\nUsing eval: false prevents that chunk from being executed. eval: true which is the default, executes the chunk. Using echo: false prevents the code from that chunk from being displayed. Using output: false hides the output from that chunk. Here are some of them:\n\n\n\nOption\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neval\ntrue\nEvaluates the code in this chunk\n\n\necho\ntrue\nDisplay the code\n\n\noutput\ntrue\ntrue, false or asis\n\n\nwarning\ntrue\nDisplay warnings from code execution\n\n\nerror\nfalse\nDisplay error from code execution\n\n\nmessage\ntrue\nDisplay messages from this chunk\n\n\ninclude\ntrue\nDisable message, warnings and all output\n\n\n\nChunk options are specified like this:\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-height: 6\n#| fig-width: 7\n```\nThese chunk arguments or execution options can also be set globally in the YAML matter.\n---\nexecute:\n  eval: true\n  echo: false\n---\nThere are many other execution options.\n\n\n1.5 Tables\nThis is a table with a label and a dynamically generated caption.\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-iris\n#| tbl-cap: !expr paste0(\"The column names are\",paste(colnames(iris),collapse=\", \"))\n\nhead(iris)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The column names areSepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Species\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables can be also be simple markdown.\n|#|Sepal.Length|Sepal.Width|Petal.Length|Petal.Width|Species|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|5.1|3.5|1.4|0.2|setosa|\n|2|4.9|3.0|1.4|0.2|setosa|\n|3|4.7|3.2|1.3|0.2|setosa|\n|4|4.6|3.1|1.5|0.2|setosa|\n\n: This is a caption {#tbl-markdown-table}\n\n\nTable 2: This is a caption\n\n\n#\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n1\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Plots\nR Plots can be plotted like below:\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-plot-a\n#| fig-cap: This is a figure caption.\n#| fig-height:6\n#| fig-width: 6\nplot(x=iris$Petal.Length,y=iris$Petal.Width)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This is a figure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 Export\nThe quarto notebook can be exported into various format. The most common formats are HTML and PDF.\n\n1.7.1 HTML\nThe quarto document can be previewed as an HTML inside RStudio by clicking the ‘Render’ button.\nThe document can be exported from R using the quarto R package.\n\nquarto::quarto_render(\"document.qmd\")\n\nThe document can be rendered from the terminal as such:\n\nquarto render document.qmd\n\nHTML documents can be opened and viewed in any standard browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.\n\n\n1.7.2 PDF\nA qmd document can be converted to a PDF. Behind the scenes, the markdown is converted to TeX format. The conversion to PDF needs a tool that understands TeX format and converts to PDF. This can be softwares like ‘MacTeX’, ‘MikTeX’ etc. which needs to be installed on the system beforehand. A light-weight option is to install R package tinytex.\nThe format argument in the YAML matter must be changed to pdf, and the pdf-engine option may need to be changed as needed. If using tinytex, set pdf-engine: pdflatex.\nSometimes TeX converters may need additional libraries which may need to be installed. And all features of HTML are not supported on TeX which may return errors.\nSee here for more PDF options."

    "text": "2 IMdB\n\n2.1 Preparations\nThe International Movie Database is a large database containing all information about movies, TV series, actors, producers, etc, and the ratings they received. If you are not aware of it, check out their website imdb.com for more information.\nYou will be working on a smaller subset of some of the data listed, which consists of movies, ratings, and the principal actors playing in the movies. You will receive a file with python functions used to query this small database from R, where you will further process the data to answer questions related to different movies and actors. The underlying Python code uses the sqlalchemy library for querying the sqlite database.\nIn preparation for using the Python code in R, make sure that the following files are all located in your working directory:\n\nimdb.db\nmodel.py\nimdb_functions.py\n\nStart by loading all the python functions into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource_python(\"imdb_functions.py\")\n\n\n\n\nFirst, inspect which functions got imported when you sourced your python file. You can find them in the Environment table in RStudio. Some of the functions listed are part of the SQLAlchemy package used, but one example to look at is the function get_actors().\nAs you can see, R creates a wrapper function in R, for calling the underlying Python function. This specific function takes a movie title as input, and returns the principal actors of the movie. You can further study what the function does by looking at the code in the imdb_functions.py file. You can see that it queries the database for a specific movie, and returns the principal actors in it.\n\n\n2.2 Get to know the data\nLet’s try out the get_actors() function.

The answers we show will mostly be using the Python pandas library from R, but there are of course pure R ways of doing the following exercises once we have converted the output from the python functions. You are free to choose how you solve the following exercises, either only python in R, a mix, or pure R. But we encourage you to mix, as you will then practice the type conversions and usages of the reticulate library, especially for those of you that are more fluent in Python.\n\n2.3.1 The highest ranked movie\nThe function get_all_movies() from the file imdb_functions.py can be used to retrieve all movies, either within a specified time period, or all of the movies in the database. If the imported function has a docstring, you can view the help documentation with:\n\npy_help(get_all_movies)\n\nStart by importing all movies into a pandas dataframe, by sourcing the python functions into R. Do not convert the result into an R dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource_python(\"imdb_functions.py\", convert = FALSE)\nmovies_py &lt;- get_all_movies()\nclass(movies_py)\n\n[1] \"pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\"        \"pandas.core.generic.NDFrame\"       \n[3] \"pandas.core.base.PandasObject\"      \"pandas.core.accessor.DirNamesMixin\"\n[5] \"pandas.core.indexing.IndexingMixin\" \"pandas.core.arraylike.OpsMixin\"    \n[7] \"python.builtin.object\"             \n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting the movies_py variable we can see that it is of the type pandas.dataframe.\nNow we are ready to answer our first question:\n\nWhich movie/movies are the highest ranked of all times?\n\nWe will try to answer this with a pandas method directly in a Python chunk. To do this we first have to make our movies_py variable visible to Python. Even though it is a Python object, since it was created within a R code chunk, Python code chunks cannot directly access them. To make R variables accessible in Python code chunks we use the r object. Remember that to access a Python variable from R, we used py$, to do the opposite we use r.. The $ and the . denotes the different ways in which Python and R represents methods.\nUse the method .max() from the pandas module to find and filter out the top movie/movies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the code below is python code written in a python code chunk\nmovies = r.movies_py\n\n# inspect what columns are present\nmovies.columns\n\n# find movies that has the highest averageRating\ntop_movies = movies[movies.averageRating == movies.averageRating.max()]\n\ntop_movies['primaryTitle']\n\nIndex(['id', 'tconst', 'titleType', 'primaryTitle', 'originalTitle',\n       'startYear', 'endYear', 'runtimeMinutes', 'genres', 'averageRating',\n       'numVotes'],\n      dtype='object')\n3822    The Shawshank Redemption\n5450             The Chaos Class\nName: primaryTitle, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we are using pure pandas code directly in our RMarkdown document.\nAfter dipping our toes in Python territory, we now go back to using normal R chunks:\nSave top_movies as an R object, and find out from what years these movies are, and how many votes they got.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmovies_r &lt;- py$top_movies\ndf &lt;- data.frame(movies_r$primaryTitle, movies_r$startYear, movies_r$numVotes)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\nmovies_r.primaryTitle\nmovies_r.startYear\nmovies_r.numVotes\n\n\n\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n1994\n2399394\n\n\nThe Chaos Class\n1975\n38290\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the answer to which are the highest ranked movies of all times is The Shawshank Redemption and The Chaos Class. Although, The Chaos Class did not get as many votes as The Shawshank Redemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Average ratings over time\nNext we want to explore how the average ratings for movies has changed over time. This one we will solve in normal R chunks, by importing the required python functions from the file imdb_functions.py, and also load pandas into R.

Regarding Conda, please refer to the link for questions about the installation. If your project includes programs written in other programming languages, e.g. Python, the overall environment can be managed by Conda.

The file should be created on the folder of your project, as fancy_project/environment.yml.\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - conda-forge::r=4.0\n  - conda-forge::r-renv=0.12.1\n  - conda-forge::r-tidyverse=1.3.0\nUsing Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command line (Windows), run following commands to create an environment and activate it.\nconda env create -n fancy_env -f environment.yml\nconda activate fancy_env"

A good reference about the package is available at Introduction to renv.\n\n3.1 Store R environment\nThe first step is the initialization of a local environment using the command in R below.\n\nrenv::init()\n\nAs an alternative, you could choose to initialize renv when an R project is created as shown below. After the command, you may find renv folder and renv.lock file created. Check the file renv.lock using a text viewer or less command on Mac/Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a package should be installed, please use renv::install instead of install.packages as below.\n\nrenv::install(\"dplyr\")  # from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"bioc::Biobase\")  # from Bioconductor\nrenv::install(\"StoreyLab/qvalue\")   # from GitHub\n# from GitLab/Bitbucket\n# renv::install(\"[gitlab|bitbucket]::`*user name*`/`*repository*`\")\n\nThe current status of R environment of your project can be stored by calling renv::snapshot(). Please note that the function checks all R scripts under your R project folder. It updates renv.lock for the packages loaded in the scripts only. Check renv.lock file again after calling the renv::snapshot(). If no R script was created under the project folder yet, surprisingly no change in renv.lock will be found.\nNow, create a simple R script that loads one of the packages you installed, for example, a file named test.R that has just one line shown below.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nCall renv::snapshot() and check the renv.lock file. You will see it becomes so long, now.\nThe renv::snapshot() command doesn’t have to be called every time a package is installed. Just make sure it should be called when an environment is to be stored, e.g. before sharing the codes and the environment with colleagues.\n\n\n3.2 Restore the environment\nThe environment can be restored on a new place by the commands below.\n\nrenv::init()\nrenv::restore()\n\nWe can test it by creating a new R project. Copy your scripts but also renv.lock to the folder of the new R project, run the commands above on R and find what the R installs. Please note that no contents under renv folder is needed to restore the R environment."

    "text": "1 R Functions\nLet’s jump right in and create a function. Your function should have it’s own function_name, atleast two parameters one of which with a default argument, code that performs some operations on the input and a return value. I do encourage you to think about it and make your own function, rather than copying the examples. Examples should be seen more as explanatory, semantic and inspirational.\nExample:\n\nfunction_name &lt;- function(param1, param2 = \"Lucy\"){\n  if (param2 == \"Lucy\") {\n    output &lt;- paste(\"Lucy in the sky with \",param1,\"\\n\",sep=\"\")}\n  else {\n    output &lt;- paste(param1,\" in the ocean with \",param2,\"\\n\",sep=\"\")}\n  return(cat(output))\n}\n\nTest your function to make sure it gives the output you would expect given different arguments.\n\nWhat happens if you don’t assign a argument to the parameter that does not have a default?\nDid I need to use the return() function in my example?\nWhy does my example perform the cat() function in the return() function?\nTry assigning a variable to the return value of your function. variable_a &lt;- function_name(\"Tom\")\nWhat happens to the variable if the return value is the output of cat()?\n\nNow lets see the power of your function in action. Write a loop that executes your function multiple times. Functions are great for performing operations on a number of files, objects or elements in objects that fit a certain condition.\n\nfor (i in c(\"Tom\",\"Mary\",\"Mahesh\",\"Henrik\")){\n  function_name(param1=i,param2=\"Brad\")\n  function_name(param1=i,param2=\"Lucy\")\n}\n\nTom in the ocean with Brad\nLucy in the sky with Tom\nMary in the ocean with Brad\nLucy in the sky with Mary\nMahesh in the ocean with Brad\nLucy in the sky with Mahesh\nHenrik in the ocean with Brad\nLucy in the sky with Henrik\n\n\nNow let’s take a look at the special ellipsis parameter for functions. Basically the ellipsis say that a function can take additional arguments. The function should work without arguments given at the ellipsis. One great example of this is the data.frame() function.\nFrom ?data.frame\nUsage\ndata.frame(..., row.names = NULL, check.rows = FALSE,\n           check.names = TRUE, fix.empty.names = TRUE,\n           stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors())\nThe ellipsis can be used to add columns to the data.frame. Try creating a data.frame with one column and one with several. Also, try creating a data.frame with no arguments for ..., what happens?\n\ndata.frame(a=c(1,2,3))\ndata.frame(a=c(1,2,3),b=c(4,5,6))\n\nAnother example where ellipsis are often used is to pass plot arguments into a function.\nExample:\n\nmy_plot &lt;- function(...){\n  plot(c(1,2,3),c(1,2,3),...)\n}\n\nmy_plot(main=\"Great title\", xlab = \"This will be X-label of plot\", ylab=\"Y-label\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry creating your own function that uses the ellipsis parameter."

    "text": "3 UI • Widgets • Outputs\nSimilar to input widgets, output widgets are used to display information to the user on the webpage. These widgets usually end in Output like textOutput(). Every widget has a variable name accessible under output$ to which content is written in the server function. Render functions are used to write content to output widgets. For example renderText() is used to write text data to textOutput() widget.\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(fluidRow(column(6,\n             textInput(\"text_input\",label=\"textInput\",value=\"&lt;h3 style='color:red'&gt;Red text&lt;/h3&gt;\"),\n             hr(),\n             htmlOutput(\"html_output\"),\n             textOutput(\"text_output\"),\n             verbatimTextOutput(\"verbatim_text_output\"),\n             tableOutput(\"table_output\"),\n             plotOutput(\"plot_output\",width=\"300px\",height=\"300px\")\n      ))),\n  server=function(input, output) {\n    output$html_output &lt;- renderText({input$text_input})\n    output$text_output &lt;- renderText({input$text_input})\n    output$verbatim_text_output &lt;- renderText({input$text_input})\n    output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({iris[1:3,1:3]})\n    output$plot_output &lt;- renderPlot({\n      plot(iris[,1],iris[,2])\n    })\n},\noptions=list(height=700))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we have a text input box which takes user text and outputs it in three different variations. The first output is html output htmlOutput(). Since the default text is html content, the output is red colored text. A normal non-html text would just look like normal text. The second output is normal text output textOutput(). The third variation is verbatimTextOutput() which displays text in monospaced code style. This example further shows table output and plot output."

Conditional UI can be defined using conditionalPanel(), uiOutput()/renderUI(), insertUI() or removeUI. In this example, we will use uiOutput()/renderUI().\nIn the example below, the output plot is displayed only if the selected dataset is iris.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",\n              choices=c(\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  tableOutput(\"table_output\"),\n  uiOutput(\"ui\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input,output) {\n  getdata &lt;- reactive({ get(input$data_input, 'package:datasets') })\n  \n  output$ui &lt;- renderUI({\n    if(input$data_input==\"iris\") plotOutput(\"plot_output\",width=\"400px\")\n  })\n  \n  output$plot_output &lt;- renderPlot({hist(getdata()[, 1])})\n  output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({head(getdata())})\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, conditional UI is used to selectively display an output widget (plot). Similarly, this idea can be used to selectively display any input or output widget."

The column name selection widget must automatically update it’s choices depending on the selected dataset. This achieved using observe() where the updateSelectInput() function updates the selection choices. Notice that a third option session is in use in the server function. ie; server=function(input,output,session). And session is also the first argument in updateSelectInput(). Session keeps track of values in the current session.\nWhen changing the datasets, we can see that there is a short red error message. This is because, after we have selected a new dataset, the old column name from the previous dataset is searched for in the new dataset. This occurs for a short time and causes the error. This can be fixed using careful error handling. We will discuss this in another section."

    "section": "6 Isolate",
    "text": "6 Isolate\nYou might’ve noticed that shiny tends to update changes immediately as the input widgets change. This may not be desirable in all circumstances. For example, if the apps runs a heavy calculation, it is more efficient to grab all the changes and execute in one step rather than executing the heavy calculation after every input change. To illustrate this, we have an example below where we plot an image which has the title as input text. Try adding a long title to it.\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    textInput(\"in_title\",label=\"Title\",value=\"Title\"),\n    plotOutput(\"out_plot\")),\n  \n  server=function(input,output) {\n    output$out_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n      plot(iris[,1],iris[,2],main=input$in_title)\n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot changes as soon as the input text field is changed. And as we type in text, the image is continuously being redrawn. This can be computationally intensive depending on the situation. A better solution would be to write the text completely without any reactivity and when done, let the app know that you are ready to redraw.\nWe can add an action button such that the plot is changed only when the button is clicked.\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    textInput(\"in_title\",label=\"Title\",value=\"Title\"),\n    actionButton(\"btn_go\",\"Go!\"),\n    plotOutput(\"out_plot\")),\n  \n  server=function(input,output) {\n    output$out_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n      input$btn_go\n      plot(iris[,1],iris[,2],main=isolate(input$in_title))\n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, changes to any of the input fields do not initiate the plot function. The plot is redrawn only when the action button is clicked. When the action button is click, the current values in the input fields are collected and used in the plotting function."

    "section": "7 Error validation",
    "text": "7 Error validation\nShiny returns an error when a variable is NULL, NA or empty. This is similar to normal R operation. The errors show up as bright red text. By using careful error handling, we can print more informative and less distracting error messages. We also have the option of hiding error messages.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",\n              choices=c(\"\",\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  tableOutput(\"table_output\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input, output) {\n  getdata &lt;- reactive({ get(input$data_input,'package:datasets') })\n  output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({head(getdata())})\n},\noptions=list(height=\"350px\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we have a list of datasets to select which is then printed as a table. The first and default option is an empty string which cannot be printed as a table and therefore returns an error.\nWe can add an extra line to the above app so that the selected string is validated before running downstream commands in the getdata({}) reactive function. The function validate() is used to validate inputs. validate() can be used with need() function or a custom function.\nBelow we use the need() function to check the input. It checks if the input is NULL, NA or an empty string and returns a specified message if TRUE. try() is optional and is used to catch any other unexpected errors.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",\n              choices=c(\"\",\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  tableOutput(\"table_output\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input, output) {\n  \n  getdata &lt;- reactive({\n    validate(need(try(input$data_input),\"Please select a data set\"))\n    get(input$data_input,'package:datasets')\n  })\n  \n  output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({head(getdata())})\n},\noptions=list(height=\"350px\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see an informative gray message (less scary) asking the user to select a dataset.\nWe can use a custom function instead of using need(). Below, we have created a function called valfun() that checks if the input is NULL, NA or an empty string. This is then used in validate().\n\nvalfn &lt;- function(x) if(is.null(x) | is.na(x) | x==\"\") return(\"Input data is incorrect.\")\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",\n              choices=c(\"\",\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  tableOutput(\"table_output\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input, output) {\n  \n  getdata &lt;- reactive({\n    validate(valfn(try(input$data_input)))\n    get(input$data_input,'package:datasets')\n  })\n  \n  output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({head(getdata())})\n},\noptions=list(height=\"350px\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last option is to simple hide the error. This may be used in situations where there is no input needed from the user. We use req() to check if the input is valid, else stop execution there till the condition becomes true.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",\n              choices=c(\"\",\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  tableOutput(\"table_output\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input, output) {\n  \n  getdata &lt;- reactive({\n    shiny::req(try(input$data_input))\n    get(input$data_input,'package:datasets')\n  })\n  \n  output$table_output &lt;- renderTable({head(getdata())})\n},\noptions=list(height=\"350px\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected there is no error or any message at all. This is not always the best to use this option as we need the user to do something. An informative message may be better than nothing.\nFinally, instead of printing messages about the error or hiding the error, we can try to resolve the errors from the previous section in a more robust manner. shiny::req(input$header_input) is added to ensure that a valid column name string is available before running any of the renderPlot() commands. Second, we add validate(need(input$header_input %in% colnames(getdata()),message=\"Incorrect column name.\")) to ensure that the column name is actually a column in the currently selected dataset.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"data_input\",label=\"Select data\",choices=c(\"mtcars\",\"faithful\",\"iris\")),\n  selectInput(\"header_input\",label=\"Select column name\",choices=NULL),\n  plotOutput(\"plot_output\",width=\"400px\")\n),\n\nserver=function(input,output,session) {\n  getdata &lt;- reactive({ get(input$data_input, 'package:datasets') })\n  \n  observe({\n    updateSelectInput(session,\"header_input\",label=\"Select column name\",choices=colnames(getdata()))\n  })\n  \n  output$plot_output &lt;- renderPlot({\n    shiny::req(input$header_input)\n    validate(need(input$header_input %in% colnames(getdata()),message=\"Incorrect column name.\"))\n    hist(getdata()[, input$header_input],xlab=input$header_input,main=input$data_input)\n  })\n},\noptions=list(height=600))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we do not see any error messages. Note that shiny apps on shinyapps.io do not display the complete regular R error message for security reasons. It returns a generic error message in the app. One needs to inspect the error logs to view the actual error message."

    "text": "13 Color generator\nA shiny app to create a distinct color generator.\nTopics covered\n\nUI layout using bslib\nInput and output widgets and reactivity\nUse of custom CSS and custom HTML\n\nThe following R packages will be required for this app: shiny, hues, bslib.\nBelow is a preview of the finished app.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core function that generates colors is hues::iwanthue(). What it does is sample colors from the HCL colorspace. Here is an introduction to colorspaces and HCL colorspace. It requires the number of colors to generate.\n\nhues::iwanthue(5)\n\n[1] \"#503F44\" \"#964FB8\" \"#97B2B7\" \"#94BF58\" \"#C6624D\"\n\n\nIn addition, this function has six parameters (hmin,hmax,cmin,cmax,lmin,lmax) to control min and max hue, chroma and lightness. This allows you to define where in the HCL colorspace to sample colors from. Hue controls the color wavelength (red, green etc), chroma controls the intensity or saturation of the color and lightness control the brightness.\nThis gives you mostly warm reddish colors.\n\nhues::iwanthue(5,hmin=0,hmax=5,cmin=80,cmax=160,lmin=38,lmax=70)\n\n[1] \"#B82E53\" \"#D22455\" \"#D34B6A\" \"#F16281\" \"#F22A64\"\n\n\nWhat we are creating is a graphical user interface around this function.\nIn this example, we will use the bslib package to create a bootstrap 5 themed layout using cards. See bslib for more info. This is the structure of the app with cards defined inside a fixed page. See help page for bslib::card() for more information on cards. We also define the page title.\n\nlibrary(bslib)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui = page_fixed(\n    title = \"Hues\",\n    card(\n      card_header(),\n      layout_sidebar(\n        sidebar()\n      ),\n      card_footer()\n    )\n  ),\n  server = function(input, output) {\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we define the inputs in the sidebar panel. The number of colors and the three parameters to the colorspace as ranges. Outside the sidebar panel we define our two outputs: an html output to display the names of the colors as hex values. In the footer, we add an acknowledgement link to the hues package.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(hues)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui = page_fixed(\n    title = \"Hues\",\n    card(\n      card_header(\n        h2(\"Colour Generator\"),\n      ),\n      layout_sidebar(\n        sidebar(\n          numericInput(\"in_n\", \"Number of colours\", value = 15),\n          sliderInput(\"in_hue\", \"Hue\", min = 0, max = 360, value = c(0, 360)),\n          sliderInput(\"in_chr\", \"Chroma\", min = 0, max = 180, value = c(0, 180)),\n          sliderInput(\"in_lig\", \"Lightness\", min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100)),\n        ),\n        textOutput(\"out_text\")\n      ),\n      card_footer(\n        div(\"Built on \", a(\"hues package\", href = \"https://github.com/johnbaums/hues\"))\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server = function(input, output) {\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we add content into the server part. The inputs are passed to the get_colours() reactive function. This function is run inside the renderText() function which outputs the colors as hex values.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(hues)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui = page_fixed(\n    title = \"Hues\",\n    card(\n      card_header(\n        h2(\"Colour Generator\"),\n      ),\n      layout_sidebar(\n        sidebar(\n          numericInput(\"in_n\", \"Number of colours\", value = 15),\n          sliderInput(\"in_hue\", \"Hue\", min = 0, max = 360, value = c(0, 360)),\n          sliderInput(\"in_chr\", \"Chroma\", min = 0, max = 180, value = c(0, 180)),\n          sliderInput(\"in_lig\", \"Lightness\", min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100)),\n        ),\n        textOutput(\"out_text\")\n      ),\n      card_footer(\n        div(\"Built on \", a(\"hues package\", href = \"https://github.com/johnbaums/hues\"))\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server = function(input, output) {\n    get_colours &lt;- reactive({\n        hues::iwanthue(\n            n = input$in_n,\n            hmin = min(input$in_hue),\n            hmax = max(input$in_hue),\n            cmin = min(input$in_chr),\n            cmax = max(input$in_chr),\n            lmin = min(input$in_lig),\n            lmax = max(input$in_lig)\n        )\n    })\n\n    output$out_text &lt;- renderText({\n        cols &lt;- get_colours()\n        paste(cols, collapse = \", \")\n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app will now generate colors as hex values, but we can’t see the colors. It would be nice to visualise the colors. One option would be to create a plot which is generating an image. An alternative lightweight option is to create div elements with the generated colors. For that we add an htmlOutput() element and a new renderText() function to the server part.\nThis function is creating a span element for each color. These spans are organised inside a div. The div and spans have a parent-child relationship. The span elements are laid out in a grid manner using some custom CSS. The custom CSS is added to the head of the app. We have also added a bit of CSS to add some space above the app so it doesn’t touch the top.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(hues)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\nshinyApp(\n    ui = page_fixed(\n      class = \"app-container\",\n      tags$head(tags$style(HTML(\"\n      .app-container {\n          margin-top: 1em;\n      }\n\n      .grid-parent {\n          display: grid;\n          gap: 5px;\n          grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(40px, 40px));\n      }\n\n      .grid-child {\n          height: 40px;\n          width: 40px;\n      }\n    \"))),\n        title = \"Hues\",\n        card(\n            card_header(\n                h2(\"Colour Generator\"),\n            ),\n            layout_sidebar(\n                sidebar(\n                    numericInput(\"in_n\", \"Number of colours\", value = 15),\n                    sliderInput(\"in_hue\", \"Hue\", min = 0, max = 360, value = c(0, 360)),\n                    sliderInput(\"in_chr\", \"Chroma\", min = 0, max = 180, value = c(0, 180)),\n                    sliderInput(\"in_lig\", \"Lightness\", min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100)),\n                ),\n                htmlOutput(\"out_display\"),\n                hr(),\n                textOutput(\"out_text\")\n            ),\n            card_footer(\n                div(\"Built on \", a(\"hues package\", href = \"https://github.com/johnbaums/hues\"))\n            )\n        )\n    ),\n    server = function(input, output) {\n        get_colours &lt;- reactive({\n            hues::iwanthue(\n                n = input$in_n,\n                hmin = min(input$in_hue),\n                hmax = max(input$in_hue),\n                cmin = min(input$in_chr),\n                cmax = max(input$in_chr),\n                lmin = min(input$in_lig),\n                lmax = max(input$in_lig)\n            )\n        })\n\n        output$out_display &lt;- renderText({\n            cols &lt;- get_colours()\n            paste(\"&lt;div class='grid-parent'&gt;\", paste(\"&lt;span class='grid-child' style='background-color:\", cols, \";'&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;\", collapse = \"\"), \"&lt;/div&gt;\", sep = \"\", collapse = \"\")\n        })\n\n        output$out_text &lt;- renderText({\n            cols &lt;- get_colours()\n            paste(cols, collapse = \", \")\n        })\n    }\n)"

In addition, install RNASeqPower from Bioconductor. BiocManager::install('RNASeqPower').\nBelow is a preview of the complete app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.1 RNASeqPower\nThe R package RNASeqPower helps users to perform a power analysis before running an RNA-Seq experiment. It helps you to estimate, for example, the number of samples required to detect a certain level of significance. The idea of this shiny app is to create a GUI for the RNASeqPower package.\nSo we first need to understand how RNASeqPower works. For a complete understanding, check out RNASeqPower. For our purpose, we will take a brief look at how it works. We only need to use one function rnapower(). Check out ?RNASeqPower::rnapower.\nSo, let’s say we want to find out how many samples are required per group. We have some known input parameters. Let’s say the sequencing depth is 50 (depth=50), coefficient of variation is 0.6 (cv=0.6), effect size is 1.5 fold change (effect=1.5), significance cut-off is 0.05 (alpha=0.05) and lastly power of the test is 0.8 (power=0.8). The parameter we want to compute is the number of samples (n), therefore it is not specified.\n\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\nRNASeqPower::rnapower(depth=1000,cv=0.6,effect=2,alpha=0.05,power=0.8)\n\n[1] 11.79489\n\n\nAnd we get the number of samples required given these input conditions.\nSimilarly, we can estimate any of the other parameters (except depth). We can try another example where we solve for power. What would the power be for a study with 12 samples per group, to detect a 2-fold change, given deep (50x) coverage?\n\nrnapower(depth=50, n=12, cv=0.6, effect=2, alpha=.05)\n\n[1] 0.7864965\n\n\nAnd the function has returned the power.\nNow the idea is to create a web application take these input parameters from the user through input widgets.\n\n\n14.2 Scaffolding\nLet’s build the basic scaffolding for our app including the input widgets. Let’s assume we are estimating number of samples.\nWe use a sidebar layout. The input controls go on the sidebar panel and the output goes on the main panel. So we need 5 numeric inputs. We can set some default values as well as reasonable min and max values and steps to increase or decrease. The output will be verbatim text, so we use verbatimTextOutput() widget.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n  },\n  options=list(height=\"500px\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app should visually look close to our final end result. Check that the widgets work.\nThe next step is to wire up the inputs to the rnapower() function and return the result to the output text field.\n Try to see if you can get this to work.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n    output$out_pa &lt;- renderPrint({\n      rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, cv=input$in_pa_cv, \n               effect=input$in_pa_effect, alpha=input$in_pa_alpha,\n               power=input$in_pa_power)\n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the inputs and outputs work. One can stop at this point if you only need to compute number of samples. But, we will continue to enhance the app to be able to compute any of the other parameters.\n\n\n14.3 Conditional UI\nThe function can estimate not only sample size, but cv, effect, alpha or power. We should let the user choose what they want to compute. So, we need a selection input widget to enable selection. And the input fields must change depending on the user’s selected choice. The rnapower() function must also use a different set of parameters depending on the selection choice. For conditional logic, you can chain if else statements or use switch().\n Try to add a selection based conditional UI. ?selectInput(), ?uiOutput(), ?renderUI().\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n          selectInput(\"in_pa_est\",\"Variable to estimate\",choices=c(\"n\",\"cv\",\"effect\",\"alpha\",\"power\"),selected=1,multiple=FALSE),\n          uiOutput(\"ui_pa\")\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n    \n    output$ui_pa &lt;- renderUI({\n      switch(input$in_pa_est,\n      \"n\"=div(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1)\n        ),\n      \"cv\"=div(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12,min=3,max=1000,step=1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1)\n        ),\n      \"effect\"=div(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12,min=3,max=1000,step=1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1)\n        ),\n      \"alpha\"=div(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12,min=3,max=1000,step=1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8,min=0,max=1,step=0.1)\n        ),\n      \"power\"=div(\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100,min=1,max=1000,step=5),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12,min=3,max=1000,step=1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4,min=0,max=1,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2,min=0,max=10,step=0.1),\n          numericInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05,min=0.01,max=0.1,step=0.01)\n        )\n      )\n    })\n    \n    output$out_pa &lt;- renderPrint({\n      \n      switch(input$in_pa_est,\n        \"n\"=rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, cv=input$in_pa_cv, \n               effect=input$in_pa_effect, alpha=input$in_pa_alpha,\n               power=input$in_pa_power),\n        \"cv\"=rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, n=input$in_pa_n,\n               effect=input$in_pa_effect, alpha=input$in_pa_alpha,\n               power=input$in_pa_power),\n        \"effect\"=rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, cv=input$in_pa_cv, \n               n=input$in_pa_n, alpha=input$in_pa_alpha,\n               power=input$in_pa_power),\n        \"alpha\"=rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, cv=input$in_pa_cv, \n               effect=input$in_pa_effect, n=input$in_pa_n,\n               power=input$in_pa_power),\n        \"power\"=rnapower(depth=input$in_pa_depth, cv=input$in_pa_cv, \n               effect=input$in_pa_effect, alpha=input$in_pa_alpha,\n               n=input$in_pa_n),\n      )\n      \n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s summarize what we have done. In the ui part, instead of directly including the rnapower() input variable in the sidebarPanel(), we have added a selection input and a conditional UI output. The content inside the output UI depends on the selection made by the user.\n\nselectInput(\"in_pa_est\", \"Variable to estimate\", choices=c(\"n\",\"cv\",\"effect\",\"alpha\",\"power\"), selected=1, multiple=FALSE),\nuiOutput(\"ui_pa\")\n\nNow to the server part where we make this all work. All conditional UI elements are inside renderUI({}) and we use a conditional logic inside it. And since we are returning multiple input widgets, they are all wrapped inside a div() container.\n\noutput$ui_pa &lt;- renderUI({\n  switch(input$in_pa_est,\n      \"n\"=div(),\n      \"cv\"=div()\n  )\n})\n\nIn the renderPrint({}) function, we use a similar idea. rnapower() is calculated conditionally based on the user selection.\n\n\n14.4 Multiple numeric input\nAnother feature of the rnapower() function that we have not discussed so far is that all the input arguments can take more than one number as input. Or in other words, instead of a single number, it can take a vector of number. For example;\n\nRNASeqPower::rnapower(depth=c(50,100),cv=0.6,effect=1.5,alpha=0.05,power=0.8)\n\n      50      100 \n36.28393 35.32909 \n\n\nAnd it expands the results in various ways.\n\nRNASeqPower::rnapower(depth=50,cv=0.6,effect=c(1.5,2,3),alpha=0.05,power=0.8)\n\n      1.5         2         3 \n36.283928 12.415675  4.942337 \n\n\n\nRNASeqPower::rnapower(depth=50,cv=c(0.4,0.6),effect=c(1.5,2,3),alpha=0.05,power=0.8)\n\n         1.5         2        3\n0.4 17.18712  5.881109 2.341107\n0.6 36.28393 12.415675 4.942337\n\n\nThe output expands in a bit unpredictable manner and this is the reason why our output widget type is set to verbatimTextOutput({}). Otherwise, we could have formatted it to perhaps, a neater table.\n How do we incorporate this into our app interface? Ponder over this and try to come up with solutions.\nOne way to do it is to accept comma separated values from the user. And then parse that into a vector of numbers. For example;\n\nx &lt;- \"2.5,6\"\nas.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",x),\",\")))\n\n[1] 2.5 6.0\n\n\nBlank space are removed, the string is split by comma into a list of strings, the list is converted to a vector and the strings are coerced to numbers.\n Update the app such that all numeric inputs are replaced by text inputs and the server logic is able to parse the strings into numbers.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n

size etc. In the server part, incoming strings are parsed and split into a vector of numbers, saved to a variable and passed to the rnapower() function. Ensure that the app works without errors and we can progress further.\n\n\n14.5 Code cleaning\nIt is good practice to check whether the current code can be cleaned-up/polished or reduced. In this example, depth is always needed and could be moved out of the conditional block. Only one variable changes based on user input, but all 5 variables are repeated in each conditional block. There is room for improvement there.\n Try to figure out how the code can be reorganized and simplified.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n          selectInput(\"in_pa_est\",\"Variable to estimate\",choices=c(\"n\",\"cv\",\"effect\",\"alpha\",\"power\"),selected=1,multiple=FALSE),\n          uiOutput(\"ui_pa\")\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n    \n    output$ui_pa &lt;- renderUI({\n      div(\n        textInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=4),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\")  textInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=100),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\")  textInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\")  textInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  textInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  textInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8)\n      )\n    })\n    \n    output$out_pa &lt;- renderPrint({\n          depth &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_depth),\",\")))\n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\")  n &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_n),\",\")))\n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\") cv &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_cv),\",\")))\n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\") effect &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_effect),\",\")))\n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  alpha &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_alpha),\",\")))\n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  power &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_power),\",\")))\n            \n      switch(input$in_pa_est,\n        \"n\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"cv\"=rnapower(depth=depth, n=n, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"effect\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, n=n, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"alpha\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, n=n, power=power),\n        \"power\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, n=n)\n      )\n      \n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI and server blocks have been considerably reduced in length by removing redundant code.\n\n\n14.6 Input validation\nWhen we changed numeric inputs to character, we lost the input limits and numeric validation. Regardless of what input you enter, the app tries to proceed with the calculation.\n Try entering some unreasonable inputs and see what happens. Try entering random strings, or huge integers for alpha etc.\nWe can bring back input validation manually using validate() functions. This can be used to check if the input conforms to some expected range of values and if not, return a message to the user.\nHere are the limits we want to set:\n\ndepth: A numeric\nn: A numeric\ncv: A numeric\neffect: A numeric\nalpha: A numeric between 0 and 1 excluding 0 and 1\npower: A numeric between 0 and 1 excluding 0 and 1\n\n Try to figure out how to add input validation. ?shiny::validate().\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\n# returns a message if condition is true\nfn_validate &lt;- function(input,message) if(input) print(message)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n          selectInput(\"in_pa_est\",\"Variable to estimate\",choices=c(\"n\",\"cv\",\"effect\",\"alpha\",\"power\"),selected=1,multiple=FALSE),\n          uiOutput(\"ui_pa\")\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n    \n    output$ui_pa &lt;- renderUI({\n      div(\n        textInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\")  textInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\")  textInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\")  textInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  textInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  textInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8)\n      )\n    })\n    \n    output$out_pa &lt;- renderPrint({\n          depth &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_depth),\",\")))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(depth)),\"Sequencing depth must be a numeric.\"))\n          \n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\") {\n            n &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_n),\",\")))       \n            validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(n)),\"Sample size must be a numeric.\"))\n          }\n          \n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\") {\n            cv &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_cv),\",\")))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(cv)),\"Coefficient of variation must be a numeric.\"))\n          }\n          \n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\") {\n            effect &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_effect),\",\")))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(effect)),\"Effect must be a numeric.\"))\n          }\n          \n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  {\n            alpha &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_alpha),\",\")))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(alpha)),\"Alpha must be a numeric.\"))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(alpha&gt;=1|alpha&lt;=0),\"Alpha must be a numeric between 0 and 1.\"))\n          }\n          \n          if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  {\n            power &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_power),\",\")))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(power)),\"Power must be a numeric.\"))\n            validate(fn_validate(any(power&gt;=1|power&lt;=0),\"Power must be a numeric between 0 and 1.\"))\n          }\n            \n      switch(input$in_pa_est,\n        \"n\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"cv\"=rnapower(depth=depth, n=n, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"effect\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, n=n, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n        \"alpha\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, n=n, power=power),\n        \"power\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, n=n)\n      )\n      \n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have added validate() to all incoming text to ensure that user input is within reasonable limits.\n Test that the validation works by inputting unreasonable inputs such as alphabets, symbols etc into the input fields.\n\n\n14.7 Theme\nThis part is purely cosmetic. We can add a custom theme from R package shinythemes to make our app stand out from the default. The theme is added as an argument to fluidPage() like so fluidPage(theme = shinytheme(\"spacelab\")).\n Try changing the theme and pick one that you like. Check out ?shinythemes. The themes can be visualized on Bootswatch.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shinythemes)\nlibrary(RNASeqPower)\n\n# returns a message if condition is true\nfn_validate &lt;- function(input,message) if(input) print(message)\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui=fluidPage(\n    theme=shinytheme(\"spacelab\"),\n    titlePanel(\"RNA-Seq | Power analysis\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n        selectInput(\"in_pa_est\",\"Variable to estimate\",choices=c(\"n\",\"cv\",\"effect\",\"alpha\",\"power\"),selected=1,multiple=FALSE),\n        uiOutput(\"ui_pa\")\n      ),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"out_pa\")\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  server=function(input,output){\n    \n    output$ui_pa &lt;- renderUI({\n      div(\n        textInput(\"in_pa_depth\",\"Sequencing depth\",value=100),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\")  textInput(\"in_pa_n\",\"Sample size\",value=12),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\")  textInput(\"in_pa_cv\",\"Coefficient of variation\",value=0.4),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\")  textInput(\"in_pa_effect\",\"Effect\",value=2),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  textInput(\"in_pa_alpha\",\"Alpha\",value=0.05),\n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  textInput(\"in_pa_power\",\"Power\",value=0.8)\n      )\n    })\n    \n    output$out_pa &lt;- renderPrint({\n      \n        depth &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_depth),\",\")))\n        validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(depth)),\"Sequencing depth must be a numeric.\"))\n        \n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"n\") {\n          n &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_n),\",\")))       \n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(n)),\"Sample size must be a numeric.\"))\n        }\n        \n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"cv\") {\n          cv &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_cv),\",\")))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(cv)),\"Coefficient of variation must be a numeric.\"))\n        }\n        \n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"effect\") {\n          effect &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_effect),\",\")))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(effect)),\"Effect must be a numeric.\"))\n        }\n        \n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"alpha\")  {\n          alpha &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_alpha),\",\")))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(alpha)),\"Alpha must be a numeric.\"))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(alpha&gt;=1|alpha&lt;=0),\"Alpha must be a numeric between 0 and 1.\"))\n        }\n        \n        if(input$in_pa_est != \"power\")  {\n          power &lt;- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub(\" \",\"\",input$in_pa_power),\",\")))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(is.na(power)),\"Power must be a numeric.\"))\n          validate(fn_validate(any(power&gt;=1|power&lt;=0),\"Power must be a numeric between 0 and 1.\"))\n        }\n        \n        switch(input$in_pa_est,\n               \"n\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n               \"cv\"=rnapower(depth=depth, n=n, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n               \"effect\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, n=n, alpha=alpha, power=power),\n               \"alpha\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, n=n, power=power),\n               \"power\"=rnapower(depth=depth, cv=cv, effect=effect, alpha=alpha, n=n)\n        )\n    })\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the completed app.\n\n\n14.8 Deployment\nYou do not necessarily need to do this section. This is just so you know.\nThe app is now ready to be deployed. If you have an account on shinyapps.io, you can quickly deploy this app to your account using the R package rsconnect.\n\nlibrary(rsconnect)\nrsconnect::setAccountInfo(name=\"username\", token=\"KJHF853HG6G59C2F4J7B6\", secret=\"jhHD7%jdg)62F67G/\")\ndeployApp(appName=\"my-awesome-app\",appDir=\".\")\n\nThe packages used are automatically detected and are installed on to the instance. If Bioconductor packages give an error during deployment, the repositories need to be explicitly set on your system.\n\nsetRepositories(c(1,2),graphics=FALSE)\n\nThis completes this app tutorial. Hope you have enjoyed this build and learned something interesting along the way. There are few more example apps below, but that is optional."

Below is a preview of the expected output.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image is a plot created in ggplot. X axis showing week numbers, y axis showing weekdays, facet titles showing months and dates are colored by categories. We can split this into two parts. The first part is preparing the code for the core task at hand (ie; generating the plot) and the second part is creating a graphical user interface around it using shiny apps to enable the user to input values and adjust dates, categories, plot parameters etc.\n\n15.1 Creating the plot\nThe first step is to figure out how to create this plot in ggplot. The data will be contained in a data.frame. The data.frame is created based on start and end dates.\n\nstart_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-06-01\")\nend_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-05\")\ndfr &lt;- data.frame(date=seq(start_date,end_date,by=1))\nhead(dfr)\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\n\n\n2023-06-01\n\n\n2023-06-02\n\n\n2023-06-03\n\n\n2023-06-04\n\n\n2023-06-05\n\n\n2023-06-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add some code to get specific information from these dates such as the day, week, month and numeric date. Finally we\n\ndfr$day &lt;- factor(strftime(dfr$date,format=\"%a\"),levels=rev(c(\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\",\"Sat\",\"Sun\")))\ndfr$week &lt;- factor(strftime(dfr$date,format=\"%V\"))\ndfr$month &lt;- strftime(dfr$date,format=\"%B\")\ndfr$month &lt;- factor(dfr$month,levels=unique(dfr$month))\ndfr$ddate &lt;- factor(strftime(dfr$date,format=\"%d\"))\nhead(dfr)\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nday\nweek\nmonth\nddate\n\n\n\n\n2023-06-01\nThu\n22\nJune\n01\n\n\n2023-06-02\nFri\n22\nJune\n02\n\n\n2023-06-03\nSat\n22\nJune\n03\n\n\n2023-06-04\nSun\n22\nJune\n04\n\n\n2023-06-05\nMon\n23\nJune\n05\n\n\n2023-06-06\nTue\n23\nJune\n06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we add a column called track which will hold the categorical information for colouring dates by activity.\n\ndfr$track &lt;- \"Available\"\ndfr$track[dfr$day==\"Sat\"|dfr$day==\"Sun\"] &lt;- \"Weekend\"\nhead(dfr)\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nday\nweek\nmonth\nddate\ntrack\n\n\n\n\n2023-06-01\nThu\n22\nJune\n01\nAvailable\n\n\n2023-06-02\nFri\n22\nJune\n02\nAvailable\n\n\n2023-06-03\nSat\n22\nJune\n03\nWeekend\n\n\n2023-06-04\nSun\n22\nJune\n04\nWeekend\n\n\n2023-06-05\nMon\n23\nJune\n05\nAvailable\n\n\n2023-06-06\nTue\n23\nJune\n06\nAvailable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is enough information to plot.\n\nggplot(dfr,aes(x=week,y=day))+\n      geom_tile(aes(fill=track))+\n      geom_text(aes(label=ddate))+\n      facet_grid(~month,scales=\"free\",space=\"free\")+\n      theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add more activities to the track column. Or in other words, I refer to it as adding more tracks.\n\ndfr$track[dfr$date&gt;=as.Date(\"2023-06-13\") & dfr$date&lt;=as.Date(\"2023-06-17\")] &lt;- \"RaukR\"\ndfr$track[dfr$date==as.Date(\"2023-06-24\")] &lt;- \"Midsummer\"\n\nggplot(dfr,aes(x=week,y=day))+\n      geom_tile(aes(fill=track))+\n      geom_text(aes(label=ddate))+\n      facet_grid(~month,scales=\"free\",space=\"free\")+\n      theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can customize the plot as you prefer. I am modifying the axes labels, changing colors and removing most of the plot elements.\n\nall_cols &lt;- c(\"#bebada\",\"#fb8072\",\"#80b1d3\",\"#fdb462\")\n  \nggplot(dfr,aes(x=week,y=day))+\n      geom_tile(aes(fill=track))+\n      geom_text(aes(label=ddate))+\n      scale_fill_manual(values=all_cols)+\n      facet_grid(~month,scales=\"free\",space=\"free\")+\n      labs(x=\"Week\",y=\"\")+\n      theme_bw(base_size=14)+\n      theme(legend.title=element_blank(),\n            panel.grid=element_blank(),\n            panel.border=element_blank(),\n            axis.ticks=element_blank(),\n            axis.title=element_text(colour=\"grey30\"),\n            strip.background=element_blank(),\n            legend.key.size=unit(0.3,\"cm\"),\n            legend.spacing.x=unit(0.2,\"cm\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plot is now ready and we have the code to create this plot. The next step is to build a shiny app around it.\n\n\n15.2 Building the app\n\n15.2.1 Layout\nWe need to first have a plan for the app page, which UI elements to include and how they will be laid out and structured. My plan is as shown in the preview image.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a horizontal top bar for the title and two columns below. The left column will contain the input widgets and control. The right column will contain the plot output. Since, this is a commonly used layout, it is available as a predefined function in shiny called pageWithSidebar(). It takes three arguments headerPanel, sidebarPanel and mainPanel which is self explanatory.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  pageWithSidebar(\n    headerPanel(),\n    sidebarPanel(),\n    mainPanel())\n  ),\nserver=function(input,output){}\n)\n\n\n\n15.2.2 UI\nThen we fill in the panels with widgets and contents.\n\nshinyApp(\nui=fluidPage(\n  pageWithSidebar(\n    headerPanel(title=\"Calendar Planner\",windowTitle=\"Calendar Planner\"),\n    sidebarPanel(\n      h3(\"Duration\"),\n      fluidRow(\n          column(6,\n              dateInput(\"in_duration_date_start\",\"From\",value=format(Sys.time(),\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n          ),\n          column(6,\n              dateInput(\"in_duration_date_end\",\"To\",value=format(as.Date(Sys.time())+30,\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n          )\n      )\n    ),\n    mainPanel())\n  ),\nserver=function(input,output){},\n  options=list(height=\"400px\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have defined a part of the side bar panel with a title Duration. fluidRow() is an html tag used to create rows. Above, in the side bar panel, a row is defined and two columns are defined inside. Each column is filled with date input widgets for start and end dates. We use the columns here to place date input widgets side by side. To place widgets one below the other, the columns can simply be removed. The default value for the start date is set to current date and the end date is set to current date + 30 days.\nNow we add more sections to the side bar panel, namely track input variables and plot settings variables. We also added custom colors.

The scale slider allows the plot preview to be scaled in the browser.\n\n## OUT: out_plot ------------------------------------------------------------\n## plots figure\n\noutput$out_plot &lt;- renderImage({\n\n  shiny::req(fn_plot())\n  shiny::req(input$in_height)\n  shiny::req(input$in_res)\n  shiny::req(input$in_scale)\n\n  height &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_height)\n  width &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_width)\n  res &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_res)\n\n  if(is.na(width)) {\n    width &lt;- (store$week*1.2)\n    if(width &lt; 4.5) width &lt;- 4.5\n  }\n\n  p &lt;- fn_plot()\n  ggsave(\"calendar_plot.png\",p,height=height,width=width,units=\"cm\",dpi=res)\n\n  return(list(src=\"calendar_plot.png\",\n              contentType=\"image/png\",\n              width=round(((width*res)/2.54)*input$in_scale,0),\n              height=round(((height*res)/2.54)*input$in_scale,0),\n              alt=\"calendar_plot\"))\n}, deleteFile=TRUE)\n\nThe fn_downloadplotname() function simply generates the output filename depending on the filetype extension.\n\n# FN: fn_downloadplotname ----------------------------------------------------\n# creates filename for download plot\n\nfn_downloadplotname &lt;- function()\n{\n  return(paste0(\"calendar_plot.\",input$in_format))\n}\n\nThe fn_downloadplot() function uses fn_plot() to create the image and then export the image.\n\n## FN: fn_downloadplot -------------------------------------------------\n## function to download plot\n\nfn_downloadplot &lt;- function(){\n  shiny::req(fn_plot())\n  shiny::req(input$in_height)\n  shiny::req(input$in_res)\n  shiny::req(input$in_scale)\n\n  height &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_height)\n  width &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_width)\n  res &lt;- as.numeric(input$in_res)\n  format &lt;- input$in_format\n\n  if(is.na(width)) width &lt;- (store$week*1)+1\n\n  p &lt;- fn_plot()\n  if(format==\"pdf\" | format==\"svg\"){\n    ggsave(fn_downloadplotname(),p,height=height,width=width,units=\"cm\",dpi=res)\n    #embed_fonts(fn_downloadplotname())\n  }else{\n    ggsave(fn_downloadplotname(),p,height=height,width=width,units=\"cm\",dpi=res)\n  }\n}\n\nThe download handler then downloads the file.\n\n## DHL: btn_downloadplot ----------------------------------------------------\n## download handler for downloading plot\n\noutput$btn_downloadplot &lt;- downloadHandler(\n  filename=fn_downloadplotname,\n  content=function(file) {\n    fn_downloadplot()\n    file.copy(fn_downloadplotname(),file,overwrite=T)\n  }\n)\n\nFinally, we have the observer function.

Shiny app code may look over-complicated on the first look, but it is easier to understand what is happening by breaking it apart into smaller chunks and understanding how the various components are connected. It is crucial to plan out the structure of your app well in advanced as it is easy to get confused. Remember to name functions and variables sensibly. Use text output widgets and/or print statements in the code to keep track of internal variable values during run-time. Go forth and build awesome apps!"

In this case the expression is the whole pipe.\nOur ‘expression -&gt; result’ is correct but can easily be missed when reading the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Chunk 2\nThe summary(x) function is a bit special: when you type summary(x) in the console, print is called in an implicit way. Pipe call does not do such implicite call, so you will have to invoke print in an explicit way. But the %T&gt;% does unbranch for one call only, you will have to make printing of the summary a one single composed call using {}. Try to wrap your mind around this. If in doubt, turn to a TA.\n\nsummary(cars)\ncolSums(cars)\n\n\n\nCode\ncars %T&gt;% {print(summary(.))} %&gt;% colSums()\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Chunk 3\nRewrite the following correlations using pipes.\n\ncor(mtcars$gear, mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n\nCode\nmtcars %$% cor(gear, mpg)\n\n\n\ncor(mtcars)\n\n\n\nCode\nmtcars %&gt;% cor()\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Chunk 4\nGiven is the dim_summary(nrows, ncols) function which takes nrows and ncols as arguments and prints this info:\n\ndim_summary &lt;- function(nrows, ncols) {\n  print(\n    paste0('Matrix M has: ', nrows, ' rows and ', ncols, ' columns.')\n  )\n}\n\nRewrite each of the code chunks below using pipes:\n\ndistr1 &lt;- rnorm(16)\nM &lt;- matrix(distr1, ncol = 4)\nplot(M)\nM &lt;- M + sample(M)\ndim_summary(nrows = nrow(M), ncols = ncol(M))\n\n\ndistr2 &lt;- rnorm(16)\nN &lt;- matrix(distr2, ncol = 4)\ncolnames(N) &lt;- (letters[1:4])\nsummary(N)\nN &lt;- N + 0\n\n\nP &lt;- M %x% t(N)\nheatmap(P)\ncolnames(P) &lt;- letters[1:dim(P)[2]]\ncor(P[ ,'a'], P[ ,'i'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBeware of a class of functions, called replacement functions. These beasts are of the form: function(arguments) &lt;- value and rownames(x) &lt;- c('a', 'b', 'c') is a good example of such beast. When writing pipes, we have bear in mind that whole function &lt;- is the name of the replacement function and thus we have to use it as such in the pipe enquoted using backticks. Yes, we know… but you wont see this too often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSometimes, it may not be possible to put everything into one single pipe and the results of running two or more pipes have to be used in the final pipe.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndim_summary &lt;- function(nrows, ncols) {\n  print(paste0('Matrix M has: ', nrows, ' rows and ', ncols, ' columns.'))\n}\n\nM &lt;- rnorm(16) %&gt;%\n  matrix(ncol = 4) %T&gt;%\n  plot() %&gt;%\n  `+`(., sample(.)) %T&gt;%\n  {dim_summary(nrow(.), ncol(.))}\n\nN &lt;- rnorm(16) %&gt;%\n  matrix(ncol = 4) %&gt;%\n  `colnames&lt;-`(letters[1:4]) %T&gt;%\n  summary() %&gt;% `+`(., 0)\n\nP &lt;- M %&gt;%\n  `%x%`(., t(N)) %T&gt;%\n  heatmap() %&gt;%\n  `colnames&lt;-`(letters[1:dim(.)[2]]) %&gt;%\n  as_data_frame() %$%\n  cor(a, i)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Tibbles\n\n1.2.1 Task 1\n\nConvert the mtcars dataset to a tibble vehicles.\nSelect the number of cylinders (cyl) variable using:\n\nthe [[index]] accessor,\nthe [[string]] accessor,\nthe $ accessor.\n\nDo the same selection as above, but using pipe and placeholders (use all three ways of accessing a variable).\nPrint the tibble.\nPrint the 30 first rows of the tibble.\nChange the default behavior of printing a tibble so that at least 15 and at most 30 rows are printed.\nWhat is the difference between the tibble.print_max and dplyr.print_min? Is there any? Test it.\nConvert vehicles back to a data.frame called automobiles.\n\n\n\nCode\n# 1\nvehicles &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% as_tibble()\n\n# 2\nvehicles[['cyl']]\nvehicles[[2]]\nvehicles$cyl\n\n# 3\nvehicles %T&gt;%\n  {print(.[['cyl']])} %T&gt;%\n  {print(.[[2]])} %&gt;%\n  .$cyl\n\n# 4\nvehicles\n\n# 5\nvehicles %&gt;% head(n = 30)\n\n# 6\noptions(tibble.print_min = 15, tibble.print_max = 30)\n\n# 7\n# In theory there should be no difference. dplyr imports tibble from the tibble package\n# and dplyr.width, dplyr.print_min and dplyr.print_min are passed down to the tibble.\n# But test both behaviours.

Use package microbenchmark. Fill in your result here in the Tidyverse Lab sheet, Tibbles – performance.\n\n\nCode\ntst &lt;- replicate(30, sample(100), simplify = TRUE)\ncolnames(tst) = paste0(rep('col', times = dim(tst)[2]), 1:dim(tst)[2])\nmicrobenchmark::microbenchmark(\n  as.data.frame(tst),\n  as_data_frame(tst),\n  as_tibble(tst)\n)\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Task 4\nDo you think tibbles are lazy? Try to create a tibble that tests whether lazy evaluation applies to tibbles too.\n\n\nCode\ntibble(x = sample(1:10, size = 10, replace = T), y = log10(x))\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Parsing\nParse the following vectors using parse_ functions:\n\nvec1 &lt;- c(1, 7.2, 3.84, -5.23) – parse it as double (any problems? why?).\nNow, parse the same vector c(1, 7.2, 3.84, -5.23) as integer.

    "section": "4 Nanopore Channel Activity Challenge",
    "text": "4 Nanopore Channel Activity Challenge\n\n4.1 Introduction\nYou will be given a fastq file coming from Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer This file contains test reads from the chicken genome. The flow-cell used here has 512 channels, each channel consists of 4 pores and only one pore is active at a time. Once your sequence gets stuck for some reason, the device will attempt to remove it from the pore by playing with reversing polarity on that pore. If this was successful, the pore will be re-used. Your task will be to visualize reading events from the meta-data in the fastq dataset and to see how each and every channel behaved. Also, you will plot the distribution of reading times.\nDatasets are available here.\n\n\n4.2 Preparations\nFirst, we will need to load the necessary libraries. I will give you a hint – you need the following libraries:\n\nhere – not necessary, but it is an elegant way of reading the data locally from the project folder,\ntidyverse – well, quite obvious why,\nShortRead from Bioconductor – to deal with short reads in fastq,\nlubridate – to figure out reading times.\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#BiocManager::install(\"ShortRead\")\nlibrary(ShortRead)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n\n4.3 Reading data\nNow, let’s read the fastq data. Check ShortRead documentation to see how to read our fastq file. Also, try to use package here. If you write: data &lt;- here::here('data/my.fastq'), the my.fastq file will be read from the data folder which is a sub folder of your project root, i.e. the folder where your r script is. It is a good practice and also prevents Jenny Bryan from coming to your office and setting your computer on fire.\nNow think a bit, to plot reading events, do we need all the data in the file or only some specific part? You may want to see some few first lines of the fastq to learn about the data structure.\n\nraw_data &lt;- here::here('labs/tidyverse/assets/FUL1_fastqs_GRID2.fastq')\nf &lt;- ShortRead::FastqFile(raw_data)\nrfq &lt;- ShortRead::readFastq(f)\nheaders &lt;- rfq@id\nclose(f)\n\n\n\n4.4 Extracting information you need\nIn this step, we are extracting data from fastq headers of each and every read in the fastq file. Not super efficient and perhaps the slowest step of the whole analyses. Can you do it better than our example solution?\nDesired output: a table (tibble/data.frame) with reads as rows and meta-data as columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will use the stringr package for string manipulation. Use str_split() to explode string data into columns and str_remove_all() to get rid of unwanted characters.\n\nTo split string on a particular character, group of characters use str_split. Here we split on comma.\n\ntext &lt;- \"This text is long, or not?\"\nstr_split(text, ',')\n\nTo remove everything following a given character, e.g. comma:\n\nstr_remove_all(text, \",.*\")\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- dplyr::as_tibble(matrix(NA_character_, ncol = 6, nrow = length(headers)), .name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(data) &lt;- c('id', 'run_id', 'sample_id', 'read', 'channel', 'start_time')\nfor (i in 1:length(headers)) {\n  data[i,] &lt;- toString(headers[[i]]) %&gt;%\n    strsplit(' ') %&gt;%\n    unlist() %&gt;%\n    str_remove_all(\".*=\") %&gt;% t()\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Preparing tidy dataset\nNow, the fun part begins:\n\nAdd column start_dttm that represents start time for a given read as proper datetime object (read lubridate docs) and\nAdd column chan that is the proper numeric representation of the channel,\nGroup reads by channel,\nArrange them by time,\nAdd time to next read (NA if this was the last read) and\nSort by channel again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRead about lead()\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata2 &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(start_dttm = as_datetime(start_time)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(chan=as.numeric(channel)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(chan) %&gt;%\n  arrange(start_dttm) %&gt;%\n  mutate(time_diff = lead(start_dttm) - start_dttm) %&gt;%\n  arrange(chan)\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Plotting events per channel\nHere, we want to see what was happening in each channel over time.

We do not expect more than 99 OTUs in a sample, so it is ok with only one trailing 0 (otherwise the 100th sample will spoil our sorting and come out like: SAMPLE100, SAMPLE01, SAMPLE10). We will need to use regular expression:\n\nAll values in the OTU column that follow pattern “OTUdigit” we need to change to “OTU0digit”.

Size, Color, Shape etc\nScale: How visual characteristics are converted to display values\nStatistics: Statistical transformations. Counts, Means etc\nCoordinates: Numeric system to determine position of geometry. Cartesian, Polar etc\nFacets: Split data into subsets\n\n\n\n\nTraditional graphing tools generally have independent set of rules for different kinds of graphs and also labelled differently such as barplots, scatterplots, boxplots etc. Each graph has it’s own function and plotting strategy.\nLeland Wilkinson’s The Grammar of Graphics introduces this idea that any kind of graph can be created by following a set of rules and put forward a framework that enables this.\nGrammar of graphics (GOG) tries to unify all graphs under a common umbrella. GOG brings the idea that graphs are made up of discrete elements (data, aesthetics, geometry, statistics, coordinates, facets, themes etc) which can be mixed and matched to create any plot. This creates a consistent underlying framework to graphing.\nggplot (Grammar of graphics) was built in R by Hadley Wickham in 2005 as an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s book Grammar of Graphics."

As you are tracking these changes you also have the possibility to revert these changes and go back in time to an earlier state of the files.\nWhy would you want to do this? It is very useful for working reproducibly to have a complete log of what you have done, it is good for backup, especially if you are also connecting and synchronizing your collection of files with some service such as github, more on that later. It is also very good when you want to work with others in a highly structured way, making sure that many people can work on the same thing without messing it up.\nThere are other advantages of course but I do not want to overload you, so in this lecture we will be focusing on basic git usage and there are loads of online resources to take you further than that."

It also functions as a backup of your repository, so if something goes amiss with your local repository, you can always delete it and grab the backup from github.\nYou can go many ways about connecting your local git repository to github. You can create the repository on github first and then create a local copy repository. You can also take a local repository and create a github repository from it.\nLets look at that as an example.\nConnect existing repository to a new github repo: usethis::use_github()\nClone a repo using rstudio File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git\npush/pull with github\nDEMO"

But I think you need to go in and get your hands dirty with this before adding more topics or you will be overburdened. Because of this and because I imagine the level of prior git knowledge can vary greatly in class I have put a lot of extra exercises with explanatory information in the lab."

There are also some differences in how you write code that is intended to be used for a package than a script for analysis for example. But I will get back to this.

From there you can use the library() command, or not if you are developing, to take it into memory. Whereas if you use type = “source” it will not infer your architecture and grab the bundled source if you will instead. This process will demand that you have the tools on your computer to build the correct binary and install."

If a function doesn’t fit in a group or is very large, it can have its own R file, but each function should not have their own R file. You should avoid using functions in your code that modify the environment of your user. For example if you use library() it will attach the package functions of your user, perhaps getting in the way of other functions he was already using elsewhere.

So you are actually writing your documentation in the same place as your code, the .R file, which is easier than going to another file and updating it. It also reminds you as you update your code to update the documentation in a natural way, and roxygen even deducts some information by itself so it is faster to write documentation. Here is an example function call_me.R with the roxygen2 documentation block preceding it. The first line will become the title and also the description if none is given. @param documents the parameter x, @return lets us know what the function returns, and notice the indentation here which I have added to signify how to add multiple rows of text and have them belong together. @examples shows one or many example executions of the code."

It makes sure your code and the code of other packages doesn’t interfere with each other. I like to think of it as a venn diagram, where each circle is a space filled with names. What the NAMESPACE does is remove the overlap, so if your function uses a function from package1, it wont accidentally use a function with the same name from package2. It does this by specifying which space a function should look for the name of a function it needs.\n\n\n\n@imports and @importsFrom\n\nDefines how/where a function in one package finds a function in another\n@imports pkg\n@importsFrom pkg function\n\n@export\n\nDefines which functions are available to user\nDo not export data\n\n\n\nIt does this using imports and exports. Like the other documentation, we can use roxygen2 to create our NAMESPACE. Using the imports tag, it doesn’t matter if our user has loaded a package with a function with the same name as one of our functions are using, because our function will know to use the one specified in imports. Exports helps by saying that only these functions of my package are available outside. If you export all your functions, it increases the risk of being incompatible with other packages, so good practice is to export as few as possible. If you are not going to share your package, just export every function."

As with most other commands, devtools has a function for this called check() which performs R CMD check and some additional operations such as automatically updating the documentation and bundling the package before checking."

There are more but I think those are the main parts and you can dive into the others if you are making an advanced package. Now let’s talk a little about hosting your package. Using version control, such as git, is a good way to work on your package, especially if you are working on it in a group. This is because it keeps track of changes and conflicts so that if multiple people are working on the same file no bugs appear. You can also setup Rstudio to work with git and GitHub. A package hosted on GitHub can be directly installed using devtools::install_github() and what you see more and more nowadays is that a stable release is on CRAN whereas development versions are on GitHub. It is also a great place for others to contribute to your code and to report issues they have with your package."

With future, instead of programming for one architecture, the code should work on most architectures. We will get back to the Unblocked R process during resolving but basically what it means is that even if multiple things are being computed in parallel the R code can continue unblocked until the resolved values are needed.\nText from article: The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved. As soon as it is resolved, the value is available instantaneously. If the value is queried while the future is still unresolved, the current process is blocked until the future is resolved.\nR package developers rarely know who the end-users are and what compute resources they have. Regardless, developers who wish to support parallel processing still face the problem of deciding which parallel framework to target, a decision which often has to be done early in the development cycle. This means deciding on what type of parallelism to support, This decision is critical because it limits the end-user’s options and any change, later on, might be expensive because of, for instance, having to rewrite and retest part of the codebase. A developer who wishes to support multiple parallel backends has to implement support for each of them individually and provide the end-user with a mechanism to choose between them.\n\n\n Building block: variable %&lt;-% {expression(s)}\n\n\nPublished 2021-06-08 in “The R Journal”: A Unifying Framework for Parallel and Distributed Processing in R using Futures"

But say that you have figured out something that you want to do for multiple numbers of datasets?\nAnd like the quote it should do one thing and do it well. Because of the power in that an R script can contain multiple functions, or “programs”, this one thing can be quite simple, or quite advanced. And like the textstream mentioned here Rscripts often take input, something we will look more at now.\nIn this case it might be efficient to use an Rscript.\nSo USUALLY an rscript is something that is executable, can take some inputs and arguments, and returns something.\nNow lets look at those pieces starting with how an rscript can be executed."

    "text": "Executing an R script\n\nInteractively: source(\"myscript.R\") in R console\n\n\nOne way to execute an Rscript is to use “source myscript.R” from an interactive session which runs whatever code is in the R script. So if it has functions or wether it reads a separate file and creates some new object, these will be in your R environment after sourcing the script.\n\n\n\nCommand line: Rscript myscript.R\n\n\nYou can also run the Rscript from the command line, or terminal. Then we use the command Rscript. It used to be not long ago that people used R CMD batch, but nowadays people usually use Rscript. Like the source, this will execute whichever code is in myscript.R but there is no environment for the objects or functions to pop into so the code in this Rscript is probably different than one that is intended for source.\n\n\n\n\nAs executable file: path/myscript.R if:\n\nScript is executable: chmod +x myscript.R\nFirst line in script is a hashbang e.g. #!/usr/bin/env Rscript\nScript’s path is included in call or $PATH\n\n\n\nYou can also execute the Rscript itself, from terminal. To execute an R script it must meet three requirements. It must be executable. It must start with this special line, specifying how it is executed if run on its own. If you want to run it without giving path, its folder must be in you $PATH variable."

It doesnt just have to be files, like functions it can also be argument settings.\n\n\n./myscript.R inputfile.vcf outputfile.vcf\n\nHere for example we are using the Rscript as an executable file, giving it an inputfile and specifying what we want the outputfile to be named. Notice that the only way the R script knows what is what is positionally.\n\n\n\n\nPackages are available that support long and short flags\n\n./myscript.R -i inputfile.vcf -o outputfile.vcf\n\nShort flags are when you give a single dash and usually a shortened version of the keyword, here i for input and o for output for example.\n\n\n\n./myscript.R --input inputfile.vcf --output outputfile.vcf\n\nAnd here long flags with two dashes\n\n\n\n./myscript.R --output inputfile.vcf --input outputfile.vcf\n\nA part of the flexibility of this is that you can give the flags in any order.\n\n\n\n./myscript.R --output inputfile.vcf -i inputfile.vcf\n\nAnd you can also mix the long/short flag order and styles.
